**Non-standard**<br></br>This feature is non-standard and is not on a standards track. Do not use it on production sites facing the Web: it will not work for every user. There may also be large incompatibilities between implementations and the behavior may change in the future.





For certain XUL elements and pseudo-elements that use an image from the[`list-style-image`](%29825 "The list-style-image CSS property specifies an image to be used as the list item marker. It is often more convenient to use the shorthand list-style.")property, this property specifies a region of the image that is used in place of the whole image. This allows elements to use different pieces of the same image to improve performance.


```
/* Keyword value */
-moz-image-region: auto;

/* <shape> value */
-moz-image-region: rect(0, 8px, 4px, 4px);

/* Global values */
-moz-image-region: inherit;
-moz-image-region: initial;
-moz-image-region: unset;
```


The syntax is similar to the[`clip`](%29392 "The clip CSS property defines what portion of an element is visible. The clip property applies only to absolutely positioned elements, that is elements with position:absolute or position:fixed.")property. All four values are relative to the upper left corner of the image.

**Note:**For a system that works on any background, see[`-moz-image-rect()`](%33022 "The -moz-image-rect value for CSS background-image lets you use a portion of a larger image as a background. This allows you to, for example, use different parts of one larger image as backgrounds in different parts of your content.").
