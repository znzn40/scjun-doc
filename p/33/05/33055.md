**Non-standard**<br></br>This feature is non-standard and is not on a standards track. Do not use it on production sites facing the Web: it will not work for every user. There may also be large incompatibilities between implementations and the behavior may change in the future.





The**`:-moz-locale-dir(ltr)`**[CSS](%427 "")[pseudo-class](%33702 "")is a[Mozilla extension](%28318 "")that matches an element if the user interface is being displayed left-to-right. This is determined by the preference`intl.uidirection.*locale*`(where`*locale*`is the current locale) being set to &quot;ltr&quot;.



**Note:**This selector is mainly used by extensions and themes to adapt the user interface based on the user&#39;s locale. (This can vary from window to window, and even from tab to tab.) It also allows extensions to work even when they don&#39;t support the user&#39;s default locale, since they can support both left-to-right and right-to-left layouts regardless of locale specifics.




This selector does not work properly from HTML; it always matches, regardless of whether the UI locale is left-to-right or right-to-left.

```
p:-moz-locale-dir(ltr) {
  color: red;
}
```
