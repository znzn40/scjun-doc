**CSS gradients**are represented by the[`<gradient>`](%28329 "The <gradient> CSS data type is a special type of <image> that consists of a progressive transition between two or more colors.")data type, a special type of[`<image>`](%28330 "The <image> CSS data type represents a two-dimensional image. There are two kinds of images: plain images, referenced with a <url>, and dynamically-generated images, generated with <gradient> or element(). Images can be used with numerous CSS properties, such as background-image, border-image, content, cursor, and list-style-image.")made of a progressive transition between two or more colors. You can choose between two types of gradients:*linear*(created with the[`linear-gradient()`](%33477 "The linear-gradient() CSS function creates an image consisting of a progressive transition between two or more colors along a straight line. Its result is an object of the <gradient> data type, which is a special kind of <image>.")function) and*radial*(created with[`radial-gradient()`](%33478 "The radial-gradient() CSS function creates an image consisting of a progressive transition between two or more colors that radiate from an origin. Its shape may be a circle or an ellipse. The function's result is an object of the <gradient> data type, which is a special kind of <image>.")).



Gradients can be used anywhere you would use an`<image>`, such as in backgrounds. Because gradients are dynamically generated, they can negate the need for the raster image files that traditionally were used to achieve similar effects. In addition, because gradients are generated by the browser, they look better than raster images when zoomed in, and can be resized on the fly.


## Using linear gradients<a name="Using_linear_gradients"></a>


A linear gradient creates a band of colors that progress in a straight line.


### A basic linear gradient<a name="A_basic_linear_gradient"></a>


To create the most basic type of gradient, all you need is to specify two colors. These are called*color stops*. You must have at least two, but you can have as many as you want.


```
.simple-linear {
  background: linear-gradient(blue, pink);
}
```


<iframe src='https://mdn.mozillademos.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Images/Using_CSS_gradients$samples/A_basic_linear_gradient?revision=1322342' width='120' height='120'></iframe>



### Changing the direction<a name="Changing_the_direction"></a>


By default, linear gradients run from top to bottom. You can change their rotation by specifying a direction.


```
.horizontal-gradient {
  background: linear-gradient(to right, blue, pink);
}
```


<iframe src='https://mdn.mozillademos.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Images/Using_CSS_gradients$samples/Changing_the_direction?revision=1322342' width='120' height='120'></iframe>



### Diagonal gradients<a name="Diagonal_gradients"></a>


You can even make the gradient run diagonally, from corner to corner.


```
.diagonal-gradient {
  background: linear-gradient(to bottom right, blue, pink);
}
```


<iframe src='https://mdn.mozillademos.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Images/Using_CSS_gradients$samples/Diagonal_gradients?revision=1322342' width='200' height='100'></iframe>



### Using angles<a name="Using_angles"></a>


If you want more control over its direction, you can give the gradient a specific angle.


```
.angled-gradient {
  background: linear-gradient(70deg, blue, pink);
}
```


<iframe src='https://mdn.mozillademos.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Images/Using_CSS_gradients$samples/Using_angles?revision=1322342' width='120' height='120'></iframe>




When using an angle,`0deg`creates a vertical gradient running bottom to top,`90deg`creates a horizontal gradient running left to right, and so on in a clockwise direction. Negative angles run in the counterclockwise direction.

### Using more than two colors<a name="Using_more_than_two_colors"></a>


You don&#39;t have to limit yourself to two colors—you may use as many as you like! By default, colors are evenly spaced along the gradient.


```
.auto-spaced-linear {
  background: linear-gradient(red, yellow, blue, orange);
}
```


<iframe src='https://mdn.mozillademos.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Images/Using_CSS_gradients$samples/Using_more_than_two_colors?revision=1322342' width='120' height='120'></iframe>



### Positioning color stops<a name="Positioning_color_stops"></a>


You don&#39;t have to leave your color stops at their default positions. To fine-tune their locations, you can give each one a percentage or absolute length value. If you specify the location as a percentage,`0%`represents the starting point, while`100%`represents the ending point; however, you can use values outside that range if necessary to get the effect you want. If you leave a location unspecified, the position of that particular color stop will be automatically calculated for you.


```
.multicolor-linear {
  background: linear-gradient(to left, lime, lime 28px, red 77%, cyan);
}
```


<iframe src='https://mdn.mozillademos.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Images/Using_CSS_gradients$samples/Positioning_color_stops?revision=1322342' width='120' height='120'></iframe>




### Overlaying gradients<a name="Overlaying_gradients"></a>


Gradients support transparency, so you can stack multiple backgrounds to achieve some pretty fancy effects. The backgrounds are stacked from top to bottom, with the first specified being on top.


```
.layered-image {
  background: linear-gradient(to right, transparent, mistyrose),
      url("https://mdn.mozillademos.org/files/15525/critters.png");
}
```


<iframe src='https://mdn.mozillademos.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Images/Using_CSS_gradients$samples/Overlaying_gradients?revision=1322342' width='300' height='150'></iframe>



### Stacked gradients<a name="Stacked_gradients"></a>


You can even stack gradients with other gradients. As long as the top gradients aren&#39;t entirely opaque, the gradients below will still be visible.


```
.stacked-linear {
  background:
      linear-gradient(217deg, rgba(255,0,0,.8), rgba(255,0,0,0) 70.71%),
      linear-gradient(127deg, rgba(0,255,0,.8), rgba(0,255,0,0) 70.71%),
      linear-gradient(336deg, rgba(0,0,255,.8), rgba(0,0,255,0) 70.71%);
}
```


<iframe src='https://mdn.mozillademos.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Images/Using_CSS_gradients$samples/Stacked_gradients?revision=1322342' width='200' height='200'></iframe>



## Using radial gradients<a name="Using_radial_gradients"></a>


Radial gradients are similar to linear gradients, except that they radiate out from a central point. You can make them circular or elliptical.


### A basic radial gradient<a name="A_basic_radial_gradient"></a>


As with linear gradients, all you need to create a radial gradient are two colors.


```
.simple-radial {
  background: radial-gradient(red, blue);
}
```


<iframe src='https://mdn.mozillademos.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Images/Using_CSS_gradients$samples/A_basic_radial_gradient?revision=1322342' width='120' height='120'></iframe>



### Positioning radial color stops<a name="Positioning_radial_color_stops"></a>


Again like linear gradients, you can position each radial color stop with a percentage or absolute length.


```
.radial-gradient {
  background: radial-gradient(red 10px, yellow 30%, #1e90ff 50%);
}
```


<iframe src='https://mdn.mozillademos.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Images/Using_CSS_gradients$samples/Positioning_radial_color_stops?revision=1322342' width='120' height='120'></iframe>



### Sizing radial gradients<a name="Sizing_radial_gradients"></a>


Unlike linear gradients, you can specify the size of radial gradients.


#### Example: closest-side for ellipses<a name="Example_closest-side_for_ellipses"></a>


This example uses the`closest-side`size value, which means the size is set by the distance from the starting point (the center) to the closest side of the enclosing box.


```
.radial-ellipse-side {
  background: radial-gradient(ellipse closest-side,
      red, yellow 10%, #1e90ff 50%, beige);
}
```


<iframe src='https://mdn.mozillademos.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Images/Using_CSS_gradients$samples/Example_closest-side_for_ellipses?revision=1322342' width='240' height='100'></iframe>



#### Example: farthest-corner for ellipses<a name="Example_farthest-corner_for_ellipses"></a>


This example is similar to the previous one, except that its size is specified as`farthest-corner`, which sets the size of the gradient by the distance from the starting point to the farthest corner of the enclosing box from the starting point.


```
.radial-ellipse-far {
  background: radial-gradient(ellipse farthest-corner,
      red, yellow 10%, #1e90ff 50%, beige);
}
```


<iframe src='https://mdn.mozillademos.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Images/Using_CSS_gradients$samples/Example_farthest-corner_for_ellipses?revision=1322342' width='240' height='100'></iframe>



#### Example: closest-side for circles<a name="Example_closest-side_for_circles"></a>


This example uses`closest-side`, which makes the circle&#39;s size to be the distance between the starting point (the center) and the closest side. The circle&#39;s radius is half the height of the box, since the top and bottom edges are equidistant from the starting point and are closer than the left and right edges.


```
.radial-circle-close {
  background: radial-gradient(circle closest-side,
      red, yellow 10%, #1e90ff 50%, beige);
}
```


<iframe src='https://mdn.mozillademos.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Images/Using_CSS_gradients$samples/Example_closest-side_for_circles?revision=1322342' width='240' height='120'></iframe>



### Stacked radial gradients<a name="Stacked_radial_gradients"></a>


Just like linear gradients, you can also stack radial gradients. The first specified is on top, the last on the bottom.


```
.stacked-radial {
  background: 
      radial-gradient(circle at 50% 0,
        rgba(255,0,0,.5),
        rgba(255,0,0,0) 70.71%),
      radial-gradient(circle at 6.7% 75%,
        rgba(0,0,255,.5),
        rgba(0,0,255,0) 70.71%),
      radial-gradient(circle at 93.3% 75%,
        rgba(0,255,0,.5),
        rgba(0,255,0,0) 70.71%) beige;
  border-radius: 50%;
}
```
