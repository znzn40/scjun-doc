SIMD.js has been[taken out of active development in TC39]41628 "")and removed from Stage 3. It is not being pursued by web browsers for implementation anymore. SIMD operations exposed to the web are under active development within[WebAssembly]21620 ""), with operations based on the SIMD.js operations.



The static**`SIMD.%type%.reciprocalApproximation()`**method returns a new instance with an approximation of the reciprocal lane values (`1 / x`).


## Syntax<a name="Syntax"></a>

```
SIMD.Float32x4.reciprocalApproximation(t)
SIMD.Float64x2.reciprocalApproximation(t)
```

### Parameters<a name="Parameters"></a>
<dl><dt id=''>t</dt><dd>An instance of a corresponding SIMD type.</dd></dl>
### Return value<a name="Return_value"></a>


A new corresponding SIMD data type with reciprocal lane values (`1 / x`).


## Description<a name="Description"></a>


The`SIMD.%type%.reciprocalApproximation()`is an approximation of the reciprocal of the lane values. This means that an estimation of the reciprocal of a number is calculated and that there can be a small amount of errors. The[Newton-Raphson division]46178 ""), for example, is one of the fast division methods that calculates an estimation. See also this[ARM/NEON FAQ article]46179 "").


## Examples<a name="Examples"></a>

```
var a = SIMD.Float32x4(1, 2, 3, 4);
SIMD.Float32x4.reciprocalApproximation(a);
// Float32x4[1, 0.5, 0.3333333432674408, 0.25]

var b = SIMD.Float64x2(0, Infinity);
SIMD.Float64x2.reciprocalApproximation(b);
// Float64x2[Infinity, 0]
```

Experimental SIMD.js has been removed from browsers. It&#39;s still available in Firefox Nightly, but will be removed in favor of a SIMD implementation in[WebAssembly]21620 ""). See also[bug 1416723]42510 "Consider removing SIMD.js?").
