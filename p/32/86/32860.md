A[CSS](%427 "")**layout mode**, sometimes simply called*layout*, is an algorithm that determines the position and size of boxes based on the way they interact with their sibling and ancestor boxes. There are several of them:


* *[Normal flow](%36178 "")*â€” all elements are part of normal flow until you do something to take them out of it. Normal flow includes*block layout*, designed for laying out boxes such as paragraphs and*inline layout*, which lays out inline items such as text.
* *Table layout*, designed for laying out tables.
* *Float layout*, designed to cause an item to position itself left or right with the rest of the content in normal flow wrapping around it.
* *Positioned layout*, designed for positioning elements without much interaction with other elements.
* *Multi-column layout*, designed for laying content out in columns as in a newspaper.
* [*Flexible box layout*](%36179 ""), designed for laying out complex pages that can be resized smoothly.
* [*Grid layout*](%29934 ""), designed for laying out elements relative to a fixed grid.


**Note:**Not all[CSS properties](%32894 "")apply to all*layout modes*. Most of them apply to one or two of them and have no effect if they are set on an element participating in another layout mode.
