* [`transition`](%33014 "The transition CSS property is a shorthand property for transition-property, transition-duration, transition-timing-function, and transition-delay.")
* [`transition-delay`](%33015 "The transition-delay CSS property specifies the amount of time to wait between a change being requested to a property that is to be transitioned and the start of the transition effect.")
* [`transition-duration`](%33016 "The transition-duration CSS property specifies the number of seconds or milliseconds a transition animation should take to complete. By default, the value is 0s, meaning that no animation will occur.")
