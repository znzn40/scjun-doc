The size and position of an element are often impacted by its**containing block**. Most often, the containing block is the[content area]30473 "")of an element&#39;s nearest[block-level]36279 "")ancestor, but this is not always the case.In this article, we examine the factors that deterime an element&#39;s containing block.



When a user agent (such as your browser) lays out a document, it generates a box for every element. Each box is divided into four areas:


1. Content area
1. Padding area
1. Border area
1. Margin area

Many developers believe that the containing block of an element is always the content area of its parent, but that isn&#39;t necessarily true. Let&#39;s investigate the factors that determine what an element&#39;s containing block is.


## Effects of the containing block<a name="Effects_of_the_containing_block"></a>


Before learning what determines the containing block of an element, it&#39;s useful to know why it matters in the first place.



The size and position of an element are often impacted by its containing block. Percentage values that are applied to the[`width`]13333 "The width CSS property specifies the width of an element. By default, the property defines the width of the content area. If box-sizing is set to border-box, however, it instead determines the width of the border area."),[`height`]14278 "The height CSS property specifies the height of an element. By default, the property defines the height of the content area. If box-sizing is set to border-box, however, it instead determines the height of the border area."),[`padding`]29242 "The padding CSS property sets the padding area on all four sides of an element. It is a shorthand for setting all individual paddings at once: padding-top, padding-right, padding-bottom, and padding-left."),[`margin`]29241 "The margin CSS property sets the margin area on all four sides of an element. It is a shorthand for setting all individual margins at once: margin-top, margin-right, margin-bottom, and margin-left."), and offset properties of an absolutely positioned element (i.e., which has its[`position`]34283 "The position CSS property specifies how an element is positioned in a document. The top, right, bottom, and left properties determine the final location of positioned elements.")set to`absolute`or`fixed`) are computed from the element&#39;s containing block.


## Identifying the containing block<a name="Identifying_the_containing_block"></a>


The process for identifying the containing block depends entirely on the value of the element&#39;s[`position`]34283 "The position CSS property specifies how an element is positioned in a document. The top, right, bottom, and left properties determine the final location of positioned elements.")property:


1. If the`position`****property is`**static**`or****`**relative**`, the containing block is formed by the edge of the*content box*of the nearest ancestor element that is**a block container**(such as an inline-block, block, or list-item element) or which**establishes a formatting context**(such as a table container, flex container, grid container, or the block container itself).
1. If the`position`****property is`**absolute**`, the containing block is formed by the edge of the*padding box*of the nearest ancestor element that has a`position`****value other than`static`(`fixed`,`absolute`,`relative`, or`sticky`).
1. If the`position`****property is`**fixed**`, the containing block is established by the[viewport]14371 "viewport: A viewport represents a polygonal (normally rectangular) area in computer graphics that is currently being viewed. In web browser terms, it refers to the part of the document you're viewing which is currently visible in its window (or the screen, if the document is being viewed in full screen mode). Content outside the viewport is not visible onscreen until scrolled into view.")(in the case of continuous media) or the page area (in the case of paged media).
1. If the`position`****property is`**absolute**`or`**fixed**`, the containing block may also be formed by the edge of the*padding box*of the nearest ancestor element that has the following:
	1. A[`transform`]6321 "The transform CSS property lets you rotate, scale, skew, or translate a given element. This is achieved by modifying the coordinate space of the CSS visual formatting model.")or[`perspective`]33006 "The perspective CSS property determines the distance between the z=0 plane and the user in order to give a 3D-positioned element some perspective. Each 3D element with z>0 becomes larger; each 3D-element with z<0 becomes smaller. The strength of the effect is determined by the value of this property.")****value other than`none`
	1. A[`will-change`]33461 "The will-change CSS property provides a way for authors to hint browsers about the kind of changes to be expected on an element, so that the browser can set up appropriate optimizations ahead of time before the element is actually changed.")value of`transform`or`perspective`
	1. A[`filter`]23741 "The filter CSS property lets you apply graphical effects like blurring or color shifting to an element. Filters are commonly used to adjust the rendering of images, backgrounds, and borders.")****value other than`none`or a`will-change`value of`filter`(only works on Firefox).


**Note:**The containing block in which the root element ([`<html>`]18723 "The HTML <html> element represents the root (top-level element) of an HTML document, so it is also referred to as the root element. All other elements must be descendants of this element.")) resides is a rectangle called the**initial containing block**. It has the dimensions of the viewport (for continuous media) or the page area (for paged media).



## Calculating percentage values from the containing block<a name="Calculating_percentage_values_from_the_containing_block"></a>


As noted above, when certain properties are given a percentage value, the computed value depends on the element&#39;s containing block. The properties that work this way are**box model properties**and**offset properties**:


1. The[`height`]14278 "The height CSS property specifies the height of an element. By default, the property defines the height of the content area. If box-sizing is set to border-box, however, it instead determines the height of the border area."),[`top`]31264 "The top CSS property participates in specifying the vertical position of a positioned element. It has no effect on non-positioned elements."), and[`bottom`]31265 "The bottom CSS property participates in specifying the vertical position of a positioned element. It has no effect on non-positioned elements.")properties compute percentage values from the`height`****of the containing block. If the height****of the containing block depends on its contents, these values become`0`when the containing block has a`position`of`relative`or`static`.
1. The[`width`]13333 "The width CSS property specifies the width of an element. By default, the property defines the width of the content area. If box-sizing is set to border-box, however, it instead determines the width of the border area."),[`left`]29604 "The left CSS property participates in specifying the horizontal position of a positioned element. It has no effect on non-positioned elements."),[`right`]29605 "The right CSS property participates in specifying the horizontal position of a positioned element. It has no effect on non-positioned elements."),[`padding`]29242 "The padding CSS property sets the padding area on all four sides of an element. It is a shorthand for setting all individual paddings at once: padding-top, padding-right, padding-bottom, and padding-left."), and[`margin`]29241 "The margin CSS property sets the margin area on all four sides of an element. It is a shorthand for setting all individual margins at once: margin-top, margin-right, margin-bottom, and margin-left.")properties compute percentage values from the`width`****of the containing block.

## Some examples<a name="Some_examples"></a>


The HTML code for all our examples is:


```
<body>
  <section>
    <p>This is a paragraph!</p>
  </section>
</body>
```


Only the CSS is altered in each instance below.


### Example 1<a name="Example_1"></a>


In this example, the paragraph is statically positioned, so its containing block is[`<section>`]36280 "The HTML <section> element represents a standalone section — which doesn't have a more specific semantic element to represent it — contained within an HTML document.")because it&#39;s the nearest ancestor that is a block container.


```
body {
  background: beige;
}

section {
  display: block;
  width: 400px;
  height: 160px;
  background: lightgray;
}

p {
  width: 50%;   /* == 400px * .5 = 200px */
  height: 25%;  /* == 160px * .25 = 40px */
  margin: 5%;   /* == 400px * .05 = 20px */
  padding: 5%;  /* == 400px * .05 = 20px */
  background: cyan;
}
```

### Example 2<a name="Example_2"></a>


In this example, the paragraph&#39;s containing block is the[`<body>`]22830 "The HTML <body> Element represents the content of an HTML document. There can be only one <body> element in a document.")****element, because`<section>`is not a block container (because of`display: inline`) and doesn’t establish a formatting context.


```
body {
  background: beige;
}

section {
  display: inline;
  background: lightgray;
}

p {
  width: 50%;     /* == half the body's width */
  height: 200px;  /* Note: a percentage would be 0 */
  background: cyan;
}
```


<iframe src='https://mdn.mozillademos.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Containing_block$samples/Example_2?revision=1365961' width='100%' height='300'></iframe>



### Example 3<a name="Example_3"></a>


In this example, the paragraph&#39;s containing block is`<section`&gt; because the latter&#39;s`position`is`absolute`. The paragraph&#39;s percentage values are affected by the padding of its containing block, though if the containing block&#39;s[`box-sizing`]32988 "The box-sizing CSS property defines how the user agent should calculate the total width and height of an element.")value were`border-box`this would not be the case.


```
body {
  background: beige;
}

section {
  position: absolute;
  left: 30px;
  top: 30px;
  width: 400px;
  height: 160px;
  padding: 30px 20px;
  background: lightgray;
}

p {
  position: absolute;
  width: 50%;   /* == (400px + 20px + 20px) * .5 = 220px */
  height: 25%;  /* == (160px + 30px + 30px) * .25 = 55px */
  margin: 5%;   /* == (400px + 20px + 20px) * .05 = 22px */
  padding: 5%;  /* == (400px + 20px + 20px) * .05 = 22px */
  background: cyan;
}
```


<iframe src='https://mdn.mozillademos.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Containing_block$samples/Example_3?revision=1365961' width='100%' height='300'></iframe>



### Example 4<a name="Example_4"></a>


In this example, the paragraph&#39;s`position`is`fixed`, so its containing block is the initial containing block (on screens, the viewport). Thus, the paragraph&#39;s dimensions change based on the size of the browser window.


```
body {
  background: beige;
}

section {
  width: 400px;
  height: 480px;
  margin: 30px;
  padding: 15px;
  background: lightgray;
}

p {
  position: fixed;
  width: 50%;   /* == (50vw - (width of vertical scrollbar)) */
  height: 50%;  /* == (50vh - (height of horizontal scrollbar)) */
  margin: 5%;   /* == (5vw - (width of vertical scrollbar)) */
  padding: 5%;  /* == (5vw - (width of vertical scrollbar)) */
  background: cyan;
}
```


<iframe src='https://mdn.mozillademos.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Containing_block$samples/Example_4?revision=1365961' width='100%' height='300'></iframe>



### Example 5<a name="Example_5"></a>


In this example, the paragraph&#39;s`position`is`absolute`, so its containing block is`<section>`, which is the nearest ancestor with a[`transform`]6321 "The transform CSS property lets you rotate, scale, skew, or translate a given element. This is achieved by modifying the coordinate space of the CSS visual formatting model.")property that isn&#39;t`none`.


```
body {
  background: beige;
}

section {
  transform: rotate(0deg);
  width: 400px;
  height: 160px;
  background: lightgray;
}

p {
  position: absolute;
  left: 80px;
  top: 30px;
  width: 50%;   /* == 200px */
  height: 25%;  /* == 40px */
  margin: 5%;   /* == 20px */
  padding: 5%;  /* == 20px */
  background: cyan;
}
```
