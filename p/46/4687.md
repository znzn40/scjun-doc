```
// "caches" is a global read-only variable, which is an instance of CacheStorage,
// For more info, refer to: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WindowOrWorkerGlobalScope/caches

caches.open(cacheName).then(function(cache) {
  // Do something with your cache
});

## Examples<a name="Examples"></a>


This example is from the MDN[sw-test example](%4722 "")(see[sw-test running live](%4723 "")). Here we wait for a[`FetchEvent`](%14342 "This is the event type for fetch events dispatched on the service worker global scope. It contains information about the fetch, including the request and how the receiver will treat the response. It provides the event.respondWith() method, which allows us to provide a response to this fetch.")to fire. Then we construct a custom response like so:


1. Check whether a match for the request is found in the[`CacheStorage`](%14313 "The CacheStorage interface represents the storage for Cache objects.")using[`CacheStorage.match()`](%14317 "The match() method of the CacheStorage interface (available globally as caches) checks if a given Request or url string is a key for a stored Response. This method returns a Promise for a Response, or undefined if no match is found."). If so, serve that.
1. If not, open the`v1`cache using[`CacheStorage.open()`](%14319 "The open() method of the CacheStorage interface returns a Promise that resolves to the Cache object matching the cacheName."), put the default network request in the cache using[`Cache.put()`](%14312 "The put() method of the Cache interface allows key/value pairs to be added to the current Cache object.")and return a clone of the default network request using`return response.clone()`. The last is necessary because`put()`consumes the response body.
1. If this fails (e.g., because the network is down), return a fallback response.

```
var cachedResponse = caches.match(event.request).catch(function() {
  return fetch(event.request);
}).then(function(response) {
  caches.open('v1').then(function(cache) {
    cache.put(event.request, response);
  });  
  return response.clone();
}).catch(function() {
  return caches.match('/sw-test/gallery/myLittleVader.jpg');
});
```
