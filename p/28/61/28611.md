The**`background-size`**[CSS](%28421 "CSS")property specifies the size of the element&#39;s background image. The image can be left to its natural size, stretched to a new size, or constrained to fit the available space while preserving its intrinsic proportions.

<iframe src='https://interactive-examples.mdn.mozilla.net/pages/css/background-size.html' width='100%' height='250'></iframe>


Spaces not covered by a background image are filled with the[`background-color`](%29451 "The background-color CSS property sets the background color of an element.")property, and the background color will be visible behind background images that have transparency/translucency.


## Syntax<a name="Syntax"></a>

```
/* Keyword values */
background-size: cover;
background-size: contain;

/* One-value syntax */
/* the width of the image (height becomes 'auto') */
background-size: 50%;
background-size: 3.2em;
background-size: 12px;
background-size: auto;

/* Two-value syntax */
/* first value: width of the image, second value: height */
background-size: 50% auto;
background-size: 3em 25%;
background-size: auto 6px;
background-size: auto auto;

/* Multiple backgrounds */
background-size: auto, auto; /* Not to be confused with `auto auto` */
background-size: 50%, 25%, 25%;
background-size: 6px, auto, contain;

/* Global values */
background-size: inherit;
background-size: initial;
background-size: unset;
```


The`background-size`property is specified in one of the following ways:


* Using the keyword values`[contain](%33786 "")`or`[cover](%33787 "")`.
* Using a width value only, in which case the height defaults to`[auto](%33788 "")`[.](%33788 "")
* Using both a width and a height value, in which case the first sets the width and the second sets the height. Each value can be a[`<length>`](%4561 "The <length> CSS data type represents a distance value. Lengths can be used in numerous CSS properties, such as width, height, margin, padding, border-width, font-size, and text-shadow."), a[`<percentage>`](%4567 "The <percentage> CSS data type represents a percentage value. It is often used to define a size as relative to an element's parent object. Numerous properties can use percentages, such as width, height, margin, padding, and font-size."), or`[auto](%33788 "")`.


To specify the size of multiple background images, separate the value for each one with a comma.

The background positioning area is determined by the value of[`background-origin`](%32977 "The background-origin CSS property sets the background positioning area, i.e., the origin position of an image specified using the background-image property.")(by default, the padding box). However, if the background&#39;s[`background-attachment`](%33763 "If a background-image is specified, the background-attachment CSS property determines whether that image's position is fixed within the viewport, or scrolls along with its containing block.")value is`fixed`, the positioning area is instead the entire[viewport](%14371 "viewport: A viewport represents a polygonal (normally rectangular) area in computer graphics that is currently being viewed. In web browser terms, it refers to the part of the document you're viewing which is currently visible in its window (or the screen, if the document is being viewed in full screen mode). Content outside the viewport is not visible onscreen until scrolled into view."). Negative values are not allowed.</dd></dl>
### Intrinsic dimensions and proportions<a name="Intrinsic_dimensions_and_proportions"></a>


The computation of values depends on the image&#39;s intrinsic dimensions (width and height) and intrinsic proportions (width-to-height ratio). These attributes are as follows:


* A bitmap image (such as JPG) always has intrinsic dimensions and proportions.
* A vector image (such as SVG) does not necessarily have intrinsic dimensions. If it has both horizontal and vertical intrinsic dimensions, it also has intrinsic proportions. If it has no dimensions or only one dimension, it may or may not have proportions.
* CSS[`<gradient>`](%28329 "The <gradient> CSS data type is a special type of <image> that consists of a progressive transition between two or more colors.")s have no intrinsic dimensions or intrinsic proportions.
* Background images created with the[`element()`](%33486 "REDIRECT element [en-US]")function use the intrinsic dimensions and proportions of the generating element.


**Note:**The behavior of`<gradient>`s changed in Gecko 8.0 (Firefox 8.0 / Thunderbird 8.0 / SeaMonkey 2.5). Before this, they were treated as images with no intrinsic dimensions, but with intrinsic proportions identical to that of the background positioning area.




**Note:**In Gecko, background images created using the[`element()`](%33486 "REDIRECT element [en-US]")function are currently treated as images with the dimensions of the element, or of the background positioning area if the element is SVG, with the corresponding intrinsic proportion. This is non-standard behavior.




Based on the intrinsic dimensions and proportions, the rendered size of the background image is computed as follows:

<dl><dt id=''>If both components of`background-size`are specified and are not`auto`:</dt><dd>The background image is rendered at the specified size.</dd><dt id=''>If the`background-size`is`contain`or`cover`:</dt><dd>While preserving its intrinsic proportions, the image is rendered at the largest size contained within, or covering, the background positioning area. If the image has no intrinsic proportions, then it&#39;s rendered at the size of the background positioning area.</dd><dt id=''>If the`background-size`is`auto`or`auto auto`:</dt><dd>
* If the image has both horizontal and vertical intrinsic dimensions, it&#39;s rendered at that size.
* If the image has no intrinsic dimensions and has no intrinsic proportions, it&#39;s rendered at the size of the background positioning area.
* If the image has no intrinsic dimensions but has intrinsic proportions, it&#39;s rendered as if`contain`had been specified instead.
* If the image has only one intrinsic dimension and has intrinsic proportions, it&#39;s rendered at the size corresponding to that one dimension. The other dimension is computed using the specified dimension and the intrinsic proportions.
* If the image has only one intrinsic dimension but has no intrinsic proportions, it&#39;s rendered using the specified dimension and the other dimension of the background positioning area.
</dd><dd>**Note:**SVG images have a`[preserveAspectRatio](%17725 "")`attribute that defaults to the equivalent of`contain`. In Firefox 43, as opposed to Chrome 52, an explicit`background-size`causes`preserveAspectRatio`to be ignored.
</dd><dt id=''>If the`background-size`has one`auto`component and one non-`auto`component:</dt><dd>
* If the image has intrinsic proportions, it&#39;s stretched to the specified dimension. The unspecified dimension is computed using the specified dimension and the intrinsic proportions.
* If the image has no intrinsic proportions, it&#39;s stretched to the specified dimension. The unspecified dimension is computed using the image&#39;s corresponding intrinsic dimension, if there is one. If there is no such intrinsic dimension, it becomes the corresponding dimension of the background positioning area.
</dd></dl>

**Note:**Background sizing for vector images that lack intrinsic dimensions or proportions is not yet fully implemented in all browsers. Be careful about relying on the behavior described above, and test in multiple browsers to be sure the results are acceptable.



### Formal syntax<a name="Formal_syntax"></a>

## Examples<a name="Examples"></a>


Please see[Scaling background images](%33789 "")for examples.


## Notes<a name="Notes"></a>


If you use a`<gradient>`as the background and specify a`background-size`to go with it, it&#39;s best not to specify a size that uses a single`auto`component, or is specified using only a width value (for example,`background-size: 50%`). Rendering of`<gradient>`s in such cases changed in Firefox 8, and at present is generally inconsistent across browsers, which do not all implement rendering in full accordance with[the CSS3`background-size`specification](%28727 "http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-background/#the-background-size")and with[the CSS3 Image Values gradient specification](%28728 "http://dev.w3.org/csswg/css3-images/#gradients").


```
.gradient-example {
  width: 50px;
  height: 100px;
  background-image: linear-gradient(blue, red);

  /* Not safe to use */
  background-size: 25px;
  background-size: 50%;
  background-size: auto 50px;
  background-size: auto 50%;

  /* Safe to use */
  background-size: 25px 50px;
  background-size: 50% 50%;
}
```


Note that it&#39;s particularly not recommended to use a pixel dimension and an`auto`dimension with a`<gradient>`, because it&#39;s impossible to replicate rendering in versions of Firefox prior to 8, and in browsers not implementing Firefox 8&#39;s rendering, without knowing the exact size of the element whose background is being specified.
