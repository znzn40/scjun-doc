## NAME<a name="_name"></a>


git-cherry - Find commits yet to be applied to upstream





## SYNOPSIS<a name="_synopsis"></a>

```
git cherry [-v] [<upstream> [<head> [<limit>]]]
```




## DESCRIPTION<a name="_description"></a>


Determine whether there are commits in`<head>..<upstream>`that are equivalent to those in the range`<limit>..<head>`.




The equivalence test is based on the diff, after removing whitespace and line numbers. git-cherry therefore detects when commits have been &quot;copied&quot; by means of[git-cherry-pick[1]](%2277  ""),[git-am[1]](%2291  "")or[git-rebase[1]](%2278  "").




Outputs the SHA1 of every commit in`<limit>..<head>`, prefixed with`-`for commits that have an equivalent in &lt;upstream&gt;, and`+`for commits that do not.





## OPTIONS<a name="_options"></a>
<dl><dt id='git-cherry--v'>-v</dt><dd>

Show the commit subjects next to the SHA1s.

</dd><dt id='git-cherry-ltupstreamgt'>&lt;upstream&gt;</dt><dd>

Upstream branch to search for equivalent commits. Defaults to the upstream branch of HEAD.

</dd><dt id='git-cherry-ltheadgt'>&lt;head&gt;</dt><dd>

Working branch; defaults to HEAD.

</dd><dt id='git-cherry-ltlimitgt'>&lt;limit&gt;</dt><dd>

Do not report commits up to (and including) limit.

</dd></dl>



## EXAMPLES<a name="_examples"></a>

### Patch workflows<a name="_patch_workflows"></a>


git-cherry is frequently used in patch-based workflows (see[gitworkflows[7]](%2290  "")) to determine if a series of patches has been applied by the upstream maintainer. In such a workflow you might create and send a topic branch like this:



```
$ git checkout -b topic origin/master
# work and create some commits
$ git format-patch origin/master
$ git send-email ... 00*
```




Later, you can see whether your changes have been applied by saying (still on`topic`):



```
$ git fetch  # update your notion of origin/master
$ git cherry -v
```




### Concrete example<a name="_concrete_example"></a>


In a situation where topic consisted of three commits, and the maintainer applied two of them, the situation might look like:



```
$ git log --graph --oneline --decorate --boundary origin/master...topic
* 7654321 (origin/master) upstream tip commit
[... snip some other commits ...]
* cccc111 cherry-pick of C
* aaaa111 cherry-pick of A
[... snip a lot more that has happened ...]
| * cccc000 (topic) commit C
| * bbbb000 commit B
| * aaaa000 commit A
|/
o 1234567 branch point
```




In such cases, git-cherry shows a concise summary of what has yet to be applied:



```
$ git cherry origin/master topic
- cccc000... commit C
+ bbbb000... commit B
- aaaa000... commit A
```




Here, we see that the commits A and C (marked with`-`) can be dropped from your`topic`branch when you rebase it on top of`origin/master`, while the commit B (marked with`+`) still needs to be kept so that it will be sent to be applied to`origin/master`.




### Using a limit<a name="_using_a_limit"></a>


The optional &lt;limit&gt; is useful in cases where your topic is based on other work that is not in upstream. Expanding on the previous example, this might look like:



```
$ git log --graph --oneline --decorate --boundary origin/master...topic
* 7654321 (origin/master) upstream tip commit
[... snip some other commits ...]
* cccc111 cherry-pick of C
* aaaa111 cherry-pick of A
[... snip a lot more that has happened ...]
| * cccc000 (topic) commit C
| * bbbb000 commit B
| * aaaa000 commit A
| * 0000fff (base) unpublished stuff F
[... snip ...]
| * 0000aaa unpublished stuff A
|/
o 1234567 merge-base between upstream and topic
```




By specifying`base`as the limit, you can avoid listing commits between`base`and`topic`:



```
$ git cherry origin/master topic base
- cccc000... commit C
+ bbbb000... commit B
- aaaa000... commit A
```
