A CSS gradient has[no intrinsic dimensions]30309 ""); i.e., it has no natural or preferred size, nor a preferred ratio. Its concrete size will match the size of the element to which it applies.

#### Repeating gradient<a name="Repeating_gradient"></a>


Repeats a gradient as much as necessary to fill the entire element. Generated with the[`repeating-linear-gradient()`]33479 "The documentation about this has not yet been written; please consider contributing!")and[`repeating-radial-gradient()`]33480 "The documentation about this has not yet been written; please consider contributing!")functions.


```
.linear-repeat {
  background: repeating-linear-gradient(to top left,
      lightpink, lightpink 5px, white 5px, white 10px);
}

.radial-repeat {
  background: repeating-radial-gradient(powderblue, powderblue 8px, white 8px, white 16px);

## Interpolation<a name="Interpolation"></a>


As with any interpolation involving colors, gradients are calculated in the alpha-premultiplied color space. This prevents unexpected shades of gray from appearing when both the color and the opacity are changing. (Be aware that older browsers may not use this behavior when using the[transparent keyword](%4569#transparent_keyword "").)
