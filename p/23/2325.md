## NAME<a name="_name"></a>


git-write-tree - Create a tree object from the current index





## SYNOPSIS<a name="_synopsis"></a>

```
git write-tree [--missing-ok] [--prefix=<prefix>/]
```




## DESCRIPTION<a name="_description"></a>


Creates a tree object using the current index. The name of the new tree object is printed to standard output.




The index must be in a fully merged state.




Conceptually,<em>git write-tree</em>sync()s the current index contents into a set of tree files. In order to have that match what is actually in your directory right now, you need to have done a<em>git update-index</em>phase before you did the<em>git write-tree</em>.





## OPTIONS<a name="_options"></a>
<dl><dt id='git-write-tree---missing-ok'>--missing-ok</dt><dd>

Normally<em>git write-tree</em>ensures that the objects referenced by the directory exist in the object database. This option disables this check.

</dd><dt id='git-write-tree---prefixltprefixgt'>--prefix=&lt;prefix&gt;/</dt><dd>

Writes a tree object that represents a subdirectory`<prefix>`. This can be used to write the tree object for a subproject that is in the named subdirectory.
