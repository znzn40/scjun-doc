**Non-standard**<br></br>This feature is non-standard and is not on a standards track. Do not use it on production sites facing the Web: it will not work for every user. There may also be large incompatibilities between implementations and the behavior may change in the future.





**Note**: Since[Firefox 58]36457 ""), this media feature is no longer available to web content — it is only available internally (e.g. to XUL / chrome code). See[bug 1396066]36458 "FIXED: Avoid exposing :-moz-system-metric stuff in content pages.")for more details.
