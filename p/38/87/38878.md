## Value<a name="Value"></a>


The[`<input>`]17158 "The HTML <input> element is used to create interactive controls for web-based forms in order to accept data from the user.")element&#39;s`[value]39956 "")`attribute contains a[`DOMString`]3945 "DOMString is a UTF-16 String. As JavaScript already uses such strings, DOMString is mapped directly to a String.")which is automatically validated as conforming to email syntax. More specifically, there are three possible value formats that will pass validation:


1. An empty string (&quot;&quot;) indicating that the user did not enter a value or that the value was removed.
1. A single properly-formed email address. This doesn&#39;t necessarily mean the email address exists, but it is at least formatted correctly. In simple terms, this means`"username@domain.tld"`. There&#39;s more to it than that, of course; see[Validation](%38878#Validation "")for a[`regexp`]39958 "The RegExp constructor creates a regular expression object for matching text with a pattern.")that matches the email address validation algorithm.
1. If and only if the`[multiple]39948 "")`attribute is specified, the value can be a list of properly-formed email addresses separated by commas. Any trailing and leading whitespace is removed from each address in the list.


See[Validation](%38878#Validation "")for details on how email addresses are validated to ensure that they&#39;re formatted properly.


## Using email inputs<a name="Using_email_inputs"></a>


Email addresses are among the most frequently-inputted textual data forms on the web; they&#39;re used when logging into web sites, when requesting information, to allow order confirmation, for webmail, and so forth. As such, the`"email"`input type can make your job as a web developer much easier since it can help simplify your work when building the user interface and logic for email addresses. When you create an email input with the proper`type`value,`"email"`, you get automatic validation that the entered text is at least in the correct form to potentially be a legitimate email address. This can help avoid cases in which the user mistypes their address, or provides an invalid address.



It&#39;s important, however, to note that this is not enough to ensure that the specified text is an email address which actually exists, corresponds to the user of the site, or is acceptable in any other way. It simply ensures that the value of the field is properly formatted to be an email address.



**Note**: It&#39;s also crucial to remember that a user can tinker with your HTML behind the scenes, so your site*must not*use this validation for any security purposes. You*must*verify the email address on the server side of any transaction in which the provided text may have any security implications of any kind.



### A simple email input<a name="A_simple_email_input"></a>


Currently, all browsers which implement this element implement it as a standard text input field with basic validation features. The specification does, however, allow browsers latitude on this. For example, the element could be integrated with the user&#39;s device&#39;s built-in address book to allow picking email addresses from that list. In its most basic form, an email input can be implemented like this:


```
<input id="emailAddress" type="email">
```


<iframe src='https://mdn.mozillademos.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/email$samples/A_simple_email_input?revision=1392192' width='600' height='40'></iframe>




Notice that it&#39;s considered valid when empty and when a single validly-formatted email address is entered, but is otherwise not considered valid. By adding the`[required]38131 "")`attribute, only validly-formed email addresses are allowed; the input is no longer considered valid when empty.


### Allowing multiple email addresses<a name="Allowing_multiple_email_addresses"></a>


By adding the`[multiple]39948 "")`Boolean attribute, the input can be configured to accept multiple email addresses.


```
<input id="emailAddress" type="email" multiple>
```


<iframe src='https://mdn.mozillademos.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/email$samples/Allowing_multiple_email_addresses?revision=1392192' width='600' height='40'></iframe>




The input is now considered valid when a single email address is entered, or when any number of email addresses separated by commas and, optionally, some number of whitespace characters are present.



**Note**: When`"multiple"`is used, the value*is*allowed to be empty.




Some examples of valid strings when`"multiple"`is specified:


* `""`
* `"me@example"`
* `"me@example.org"`
* `"me@example.org,you@example.org"`
* `"me@example.org, you@example.org"`
* `"me@example.org,you@example.org, us@example.org"`


Some examples of invalid strings:


* `","`
* `"me"`
* `"me@example.org you@example.org"`

### Placeholders<a name="Placeholders"></a>


Sometimes it&#39;s helpful to offer an in-context hint as to what form the input data should take. This can be especially important if the page design doesn&#39;t offer descriptive labels for each[`<input>`]17158 "The HTML <input> element is used to create interactive controls for web-based forms in order to accept data from the user."). This is where**placeholders**come in. A placeholder is a value that demonstrates the form the`value`should take by presenting an example of a valid value, which is displayed inside the edit box when the element&#39;s`value`is`""`. Once data is entered into the box, the placeholder disappears; if the box is emptied, the placeholder reappears.



Here, we have an`"email"`input with the placeholder`"sophie@example.com"`. Note how the placeholder disappears and reappears as you manipulate the contents of the edit field.


```
<input type="email" placeholder="sophie@example.com">
```


<iframe src='https://mdn.mozillademos.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/email$samples/Placeholders?revision=1392192' width='600' height='40'></iframe>



### Controlling the input size<a name="Controlling_the_input_size"></a>


You can control not only the physical length of the input box, but also the minimum and maximum lengths allowed for the input text itself.


#### Physical input element size<a name="Physical_input_element_size"></a>


The physical size of the input box can be controlled using the`[size]39955 "")`attribute. With it, you can specify the number of characters the input box can display at a time. In this example the email edit box is 15 characters wide:


```
<input type="email" size="15">
```


<iframe src='https://mdn.mozillademos.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/email$samples/Physical_input_element_size?revision=1392192' width='600' height='40'></iframe>



#### Element value length<a name="Element_value_length"></a>


The`size`is separate from the length limitation on the entered email address itself so that you can have fields fit in a small space while still allowing longer email address strings to be entered. You can specify a minimum length, in characters, for the entered email address using the`[minlength]39953 "")`attribute; similarly, use`[maxlength]39952 "")`to set the maximum length of the entered email address.



The example below creates a 32 character-wide email address entry box, requiring that the contents be no shorter than 3 characters and no longer than 64 characters.


```
<input type="email" size="32" minlength="3" maxlength="64">
```


<iframe src='https://mdn.mozillademos.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/email$samples/Element_value_length?revision=1392192' width='600' height='40'></iframe>



### Providing default options<a name="Providing_default_options"></a>


As always, you can provide a default value for an`"email"`input box by setting its`[value]39956 "")`attribute:


```
<input type="email" value="default@example.com">
```



<iframe src='https://mdn.mozillademos.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/email$samples/Default_value?revision=1392192' width='600' height='40'></iframe>



#### Offering suggested values<a name="Offering_suggested_values"></a>


Taking it a step farther, you can provide a list of default options from which the user can select by specifying the`[list]39951 "")`attribute. This doesn&#39;t limit the user to those options, but does allow them to select commonly-used email addresses more quickly. This also offers hints to`[autocomplete]39950 "")`. The`list`attribute specifies the ID of a[`<datalist>`]12283 "The HTML <datalist> element contains a set of <option> elements that represent the values available for other controls."), which in turn contains one[`<option>`]13016 "The HTML <option> element is used to define an item contained in a <select>, an <optgroup>, or a <datalist> element. As such, <option> can represent menu items in popups and other lists of items in an HTML document.")element per suggested value; each`option`&#39;s`value`is the corresponding suggested value for the email entry box.


```
<input type="email" size="40" list="defaultEmails">

<datalist id="defaultEmails">
  <option value="jbond007@mi6.defence.gov.uk">
  <option value="jbourne@unknown.net">
  <option value="nfury@shield.org">
  <option value="tony@starkindustries.com">
  <option value="hulk@grrrrrrrr.arg">
</datalist>
```


<iframe src='https://mdn.mozillademos.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/email$samples/Offering_suggested_values?revision=1392192' width='600' height='40'></iframe>




With the[`<datalist>`]12283 "The HTML <datalist> element contains a set of <option> elements that represent the values available for other controls.")element and its[`<option>`]13016 "The HTML <option> element is used to define an item contained in a <select>, an <optgroup>, or a <datalist> element. As such, <option> can represent menu items in popups and other lists of items in an HTML document.")s in place, the browser will offer the specified values as potential values for the email address; this is typically presented as a popup or drop-down menu containing the suggestions. While the specific user experience may vary from one browser to another, typically clicking in the edit box presents a drop-down of the suggested email addresses. Then, as the user types, the list is filtered to show only matching values. Each typed character narrows down the list until the user makes a selection or types a custom value.



![Animation: Using keyboard entry to filter the list of suggested email addresses](%39944.gif "")


## Validation<a name="Validation"></a>


There are two levels of content validation available for`"email"`inputs. First, there&#39;s the standard level of validation offered to all[`<input>`]17158 "The HTML <input> element is used to create interactive controls for web-based forms in order to accept data from the user.")s, which automatically ensures that the contents meet the requirements to be a valid email address. But there&#39;s also the option to add additional filtering to ensure that your own specialized needs are met, if you have any.



**Important**: HTML form validation is*not*a substitute for scripts that ensure that the entered data is in the proper format. It&#39;s far too easy for someone to make adjustments to the HTML that allow them to bypass the validation, or to remove it completely. It&#39;s also possible for someone to simply bypass your HTML entirely and submit the data directly to your server. If your server-side code fails to validate the data it receives, disaster could strike when improperly-formatted data (or data which is too large, is of the wrong type, and so forth) is entered into your database.



### Basic validation<a name="Basic_validation"></a>


Browsers that support the`"email"`input type automatically provide validation to ensure that only text that matches the standard format for Internet email addresses is entered into the input box. Browsers that implement the specification should be using an algorithm equivalent to the following regular expression:


```
/^[a-zA-Z0-9.!#$%&'*+\/=?^_`{|}~-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9](?:[a-zA-Z0-9-]{0,61}
  [a-zA-Z0-9])?(?:\.[a-zA-Z0-9](?:[a-zA-Z0-9-]{0,61}[a-zA-Z0-9])?)*$/
```


To learn more about how form validation works and how to take advantage of the[`:valid`]34532 "The :valid CSS pseudo-class represents any <input> or other <form> element whose contents validate successfully. This allows to easily make valid fields adopt an appearance that helps the user confirm that their data is formatted properly.")and[`:invalid`]34512 "The :invalid CSS pseudo-class represents any <input> or other <form> element whose contents fail to validate.")CSS properties to style the input based on whether or not the current value is valid, see[Form data validation]30573 "").



**Note**: There are known specification issues related to international domain names and the validation of email addresses in HTML. See[W3C bug 15489]39959 "")for details.



### Pattern validation<a name="Pattern_validation"></a>


If you need the entered email address to be restricted further than just &quot;any string that looks like an email address,&quot; you can use the`[pattern]39954 "")`attribute to specify a[regular expression]36965 "")the value must match for it to be valid. If the`[multiple]39948 "")`attribute is specified, each individual item in the comma-delineated list of values must match the[`regexp`]39958 "The RegExp constructor creates a regular expression object for matching text with a pattern.").



For example, let&#39;s say you&#39;re building a page for employees of Best Startup Ever, Inc. which will let them contact their IT department for help. In our simplified form, the user needs to enter their email address and a message describing the problem they need help with. We want to ensure that not only does the user provide a valid email address, but for security purposes, we require that the address be an internal corporate email address.



Since inputs of type`"email"`validate against both the standard email address validation*and*the specified`[pattern]39954 "")`, you can implement this easily. Let&#39;s see how:


```
<form>
 <div class="emailBox">
   <label for="emailAddress">Your email address</label><br>
   <input id="emailAddress" type="email" size="64" maxLength="64" required
          placeholder="username@beststartupever.com" pattern=".+@beststartupever.com"
          title="Please provide only a Best Startup Ever corporate email address">
 </div>

 <div class="messageBox">
   <label for="message">Request</label><br>
   <textarea id="message" cols="80" rows="8" required
             placeholder="My shoes are too tight, and I have forgotten how to dance."></textarea>
 </div>
  <input type="submit" value="Send Request">
</form>
```


<iframe src='https://mdn.mozillademos.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/email$samples/Pattern_validation?revision=1392192' width='700' height='275'></iframe>




Our[`<form>`]12729 "The HTML <form> element represents a document section that contains interactive controls for submitting information to a web server.")contains one[`<input>`]17158 "The HTML <input> element is used to create interactive controls for web-based forms in order to accept data from the user.")of type`"email"`for the user&#39;s email address, a[`<textarea>`]25792 "The HTML <textarea> element represents a multi-line plain-text editing control, useful when you want to allow users to enter a sizeable amount of free-form text, for example a comment on a review or feedback form.")to enter their message for IT into, and an`<input>`of type`[&quot;submit&quot;]39765 "")`, which creates a button to submit the form. Each text entry box has a[`<label>`]12888 "The HTML <label> element represents a caption for an item in a user interface.")associated with it to let the user know what&#39;s expected of them.



Let&#39;s take a closer look at the email address entry box. Its`[size]39955 "")`and`[maxlength]39952 "")`attributes are both set to 64 in order to show room for 64 characters worth of email address, and to limit the number of characters actually entered to a maximum of 64. The`[required]38131 "")`attribute is specified, making it mandatory that a valid email address be provided.



An appropriate`[placeholder]35699 "")`is provided—`"username@beststartupever.com"`—to demonstrate what constitutes a valid entry. This string demonstrates both that an email address should be entered, and suggests that it should be a corporate beststartupever.com account. This is in addition to the fact that using type`"email"`will validate the text to ensure that it&#39;s formatted like an email address. If the text in the input box isn&#39;t an email address, you&#39;ll get an error message that looks something like this:



![](%39945.png "")



If we left things at that, we would at least be validating on legitimate email addresses. But we want to go one step farther: we want to make sure that the email address is in fact in the form &quot;*username*@beststartupever.com&quot;. This is where we&#39;ll use`[pattern]39954 "")`. We set`pattern`to`".+@beststartupever.com"`. This simple regular expression requests a string that consists of at least one character of any kind, then an &quot;@&quot; followed by the domain name &quot;beststartupever.com&quot;.



Note that this is not even close to an adequate filter for valid email addresses; it would allow things such as &quot; @beststartupever.com&quot; (note the leading space) or &quot;@@beststartupever.com&quot;, neither of which is valid. However, the browser runs both the standard email address filter*and*our custom pattern against the specified text. As a result, we wind up with a validation which says &quot;make sure this is a valid email address, and if it is, make sure it&#39;s also a beststartupever.com address.&quot;



It&#39;s advisable to use the`[title]39960 "")`attribute along with`pattern`. If you do, the`title`*must*describe the pattern. That is, it should explain what format the data should take on, rather than any other information. That&#39;s because the`title`may be displayed or spoken as part of a validation error message. For example, the browser might present the message &quot;The entered text doesn&#39;t match the required pattern.&quot; followed by your specified`title`. If your`title`is something like &quot;Email address&quot;, the result would be the message &quot;The entered text doesn&#39;t match the required pattern. Email address&quot;, which isn&#39;t very good.



That&#39;s why, instead, we specify the string &quot;Please provide only a Best Startup Ever corporate email address&quot; By doing that, the resulting full error message might be something like &quot;The entered text doesn&#39;t match the required pattern. Please provide only a Best Startup Ever corporate email address.&quot;



![](%39946.png "")



**Note**: If you run into trouble while writing your validation regular expressions and they&#39;re not working properly, check your browser&#39;s console; there may be helpful error messages there to aid you in solving the problem.



## Examples<a name="Examples"></a>


Here we have an email input with the ID`"emailAddress"`which is allowed to be up to a maximum of 256 characters long. The input box itself is physically 64 characters wide, and displays the text`"user@example.gov"`as a placeholder anytime the field is empty. In addition, by using the`[multiple]39948 "")`attribute, the box is configured to allow the user to enter zero or more email addresses, separated by commas, as described in[Allowing multiple email addresses](%38878#Allowing_multiple_email_addresses ""). As a final touch, the`[list]39951 "")`attribute contains the ID of a[`<datalist>`]12283 "The HTML <datalist> element contains a set of <option> elements that represent the values available for other controls.")whose[`<option>`]13016 "The HTML <option> element is used to define an item contained in a <select>, an <optgroup>, or a <datalist> element. As such, <option> can represent menu items in popups and other lists of items in an HTML document.")s specify a set of suggested values the user can choose from.



As an added touch, the[`<label>`]12888 "The HTML <label> element represents a caption for an item in a user interface.")element is used to establish a label for the email entry box, with its`[for]37735 "")`attribute referencing the`"emailAddress"`ID of the[`<input>`]17158 "The HTML <input> element is used to create interactive controls for web-based forms in order to accept data from the user.")element. By associating the two elements in this way, clicking on the label will focus the input element.
