**CSS Writing Modes**is a CSS module that defines various international writing modes, such as left-to-right (e.g. used by Latin and Indic scripts), right-to-left (e.g. used by Hebrew or Arabic scripts), bidirectional (used when mixing left-to-right and right-to-left scripts) and vertical (e.g. used by some Asian scripts).

* [`direction`]28805 "The direction CSS property sets the direction of text, table columns, and horizontal overflow.")
* [`glyph-orientation-horizontal`]38674 "The documentation about this has not yet been written; please consider contributing!")
* [`text-combine-upright`]32148 "The text-combine-upright CSS property specifies the combination of multiple characters into the space of a single character. If the combined text is wider than 1em, the user agent must fit the contents within 1em. The resulting composition is treated as a single upright glyph for layout and decoration. This property only has an effect in vertical writing modes.")
* [`text-orientation`]28806 "The text-orientation CSS property defines the orientation of the text characters in a line. This property only has an effect in vertical mode, that is, when writing-mode is not horizontal-tb. It is useful for controlling the display of languages that use vertical script, and also for making vertical table headers.")
* [`unicode-bidi`]29725 "The unicode-bidi CSS property, together with the direction property, determines how bidirectional text in a document is handled. For example, if a block of content contains both left-to-right and right-to-left text, the user-agent uses a complex Unicode algorithm to decide how to display the text. The unicode-bidi property overrides this algorithm and allows the developer to control the text embedding.")
* [`writing-mode`]28772 "The writing-mode CSS property defines whether lines of text are laid out horizontally or vertically, as well as the direction in which blocks progress.")
