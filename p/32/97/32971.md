**Deprecated**<br></br>This feature has been removed from the Web standards. Though some browsers may still support it, it is in the process of being dropped. Avoid using it and update existing code if possible; see the[compatibility table](%36496 "")at the bottom of this page to guide your decision. Be aware that this feature may cease to work at any time.




**Non-standard**<br></br>This feature is non-standard and is not on a standards track. Do not use it on production sites facing the Web: it will not work for every user. There may also be large incompatibilities between implementations and the behavior may change in the future.





The**`-moz-user-modify`**property has no effect. It was originally planned to determine whether or not the content of an element can be edited by a user.


```
/* Keyword values */
-moz-user-modify: read-only;
-moz-user-modify: read-write;
-moz-user-modify: write-only;

/* Global values */
-moz-user-modify: inherit;
-moz-user-modify: initial;
-moz-user-modify: unset;
```


This property is related to the`[contenteditable](%34351 "")`attribute.


[Initial value](%28552 "") | `read-only` 
Applies to | all elements 
[Inherited](%28555 "") | yes 
Media | interactive 
[Computed value](%28556 "") | as specified 
Animation type | discrete 
Canonical order | the unique non-ambiguous order defined by the formal grammar 


## Syntax<a name="Syntax"></a>


The`-moz-user-modify`property is specified as one of the keyword values from the list below.

## Specifications<a name="Specifications"></a>


This property is not part of any specification. A similar property,`user-focus`, was proposed in[early drafts of a predecessor of the CSS3 UI specification](%36486 ""), but was rejected by the working group.
