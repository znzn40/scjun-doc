SIMD.js has been[taken out of active development in TC39]41628 "")and removed from Stage 3. It is not being pursued by web browsers for implementation anymore. SIMD operations exposed to the web are under active development within[WebAssembly]21620 ""), with operations based on the SIMD.js operations.



Note: The Float64x2 type is currently not part of the SIMD specification draft.




The**`SIMD.Float64x2`**data type is a 128-bit vector divided into 2 lanes storing double precision floating point values.

## Syntax<a name="Syntax"></a>

```
SIMD.Float64x2(x, y);
```

### Parameters<a name="Parameters"></a>
<dl><dt id=''>`x`Optional</dt><dd>A double specifying the value of the first lane. Defaults to[`NaN`]22328 "The global NaN property is a value representing Not-A-Number.").</dd><dt id=''>`y`Optional</dt><dd>A double specifying the value of the second lane. Defaults to[`NaN`]22328 "The global NaN property is a value representing Not-A-Number.").</dd></dl>
## Constructor functions<a name="Constructor_functions"></a>


In addition to the simple creator functions, the SIMD API provides the following constructor functions:

<dl><dt id=''>[`SIMD.Float64x2.splat()`]42564 "SIMD.js has been taken out of active development in TC39 and removed from Stage 3. It is not being pursued by web browsers for implementation anymore. SIMD operations exposed to the web are under active development within WebAssembly, with operations based on the SIMD.js operations.")</dt><dd>Creates a Float64x2 with all lanes set to a given value.</dd></dl>

Note that you can also[convert from another SIMD data type to Float64x2](%40548#Data_conversions "").



**Note:**SIMD types don&#39;t work with`new`, as SIMD values are no &quot;boxed&quot; objects (comparable to`String(s)`vs.`new String(s)`, which creates a String object).


```
var v = new SIMD.Float64x2(1, 2); 
// TypeError: SIMD.Float64x2 is not a constructor
var w = new SIMD.Float64x2.splat(3); 
// TypeError: SIMD.Float64x2.splat is not a constructor
```


Instead, you just write:


```
var v = SIMD.Float64x2(1, 2); 
var w = SIMD.Float64x2.splat(3);
```

## Specifications<a name="Specifications"></a>


The Float64x2 type is currently not part of the SIMD specification draft.


## Browser compatibility<a name="Browser_compatibility"></a>


Experimental SIMD.js has been removed from browsers. It&#39;s still available in Firefox Nightly, but will be removed in favor of a SIMD implementation in[WebAssembly]21620 ""). See also[bug 1416723]42510 "Consider removing SIMD.js?").
