`<input>`elements of type`**&quot;week&quot;**`create input fields allowing easy entry of a year plus the[ISO 8601 week number]40122 "")during that year (i.e., week 1 to[52 or 53]40122 "")).



The control&#39;s user interface varies from browser to browser; cross-browser support is currently a bit limited, with only Chrome/Opera and Microsoft Edge supporting it at this time. In non-supporting browsers, the control degrades gracefully to function identically to`[&lt;input type=&quot;text&quot;&gt;]37431 "")`.

<iframe src='https://interactive-examples.mdn.mozilla.net/pages/tabbed/input-week.html' width='100%' height='250'></iframe>


In Chrome/Opera the`week`control provides slots to fill in week and year values, a pop-up calendar interface to select them more visually, and an &quot;X&quot; button to clear the control&#39;s value.

The Edge`week`control is somewhat more elaborate, opening up week and year pickers with sliding reels.

**[Value](%38903#Value "")** | A[`DOMString`]3945 "DOMString is a UTF-16 String. As JavaScript already uses such strings, DOMString is mapped directly to a String.")representing a week and year, or empty.

**Supported Common Attributes** | `[autocomplete]39950 "")`,`[list]39951 "")`,`[readonly]38144 "")`, and`[step]40038 "")`.

## Value<a name="Value"></a>


A[`DOMString`]3945 "DOMString is a UTF-16 String. As JavaScript already uses such strings, DOMString is mapped directly to a String.")representing the value of the week/year entered into the input. You can set a default value for the input by including a value inside the`[value]39956 "")`attribute, like so:


```
<label for="week">What week would you like to start?</label>
<input id="week" type="week" name="week" value="2017-W01">
```


<iframe src='https://mdn.mozillademos.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/week$samples/Value?revision=1392199' width='600' height='60'></iframe>




One thing to note is that the displayed format may differ from the actual`value`, which is always formatted`yyyy-Www`. When the above value is submitted to the server, for example, browsers may display it as`Week 01, 2017`, but the submitted value will always look like`week=2017-W01`.



You can also get and set the value in JavaScript using the[`HTMLInputElement.value`]40062 "The documentation about this has not yet been written; please consider contributing!")property, for example:


```
var weekControl = document.querySelector('input[type="week"]');
weekControl.value = '2017-W45';
```

## Using week inputs<a name="Using_week_inputs"></a>


Week inputs sound convenient at first glance, since they provide an easy UI for choosing weeks, and they normalize the data format sent to the server, regardless of the user&#39;s browser or locale. However, there are issues with`<input type="week">`because browser support is not guaranteed across all browsers.



We&#39;ll look at basic and more complex uses of`<input type="week">`, then offer advice on mitigating the browser support issue later on (see[Handling browser support](%38903#Handling_browser_support "")).


### Basic uses of week<a name="Basic_uses_of_week"></a>


The simplest use of`<input type="week">`involves a basic`<input>`and[`<label>`]12888 "The HTML <label> element represents a caption for an item in a user interface.")element combination, as seen below:


```
<form>
  <label for="week">What week would you like to start?</label>
  <input id="week" type="week" name="week">
</form>
```


<iframe src='https://mdn.mozillademos.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/week$samples/Basic_uses_of_week?revision=1392199' width='600' height='40'></iframe>



### Controlling input size<a name="Controlling_input_size"></a>


`<input type="week">`doesn&#39;t support form sizing attributes such as`[size]39955 "")`. You&#39;ll have to resort to[CSS]427 "")for sizing needs.


### Using the step attribute<a name="Using_the_step_attribute"></a>


You should be able to use the`[step]40038 "")`attribute to vary the number of weeks jumped whenever they are incremented or decremented, however it doesn&#39;t seem to have any effect on supporting browsers.


## Validation<a name="Validation"></a>


By default,`<input type="week">`does not apply any validation to entered values. The UI implementations generally don&#39;t let you specify anything that isn&#39;t a valid week/year, which is helpful, but it&#39;s still possible to submit with the field empty, and you might want to restrict the range of choosable weeks.


### Setting maximum and minimum weeks<a name="Setting_maximum_and_minimum_weeks"></a>


You can use the`[min]38060 "")`and`[max]38061 "")`attributes to restrict the valid weeks that can be chosen by the user. In the following example we are setting a minimum value of`Week 01, 2017`and a maximum value of`Week 52, 2017`:


```
<form>
  <label for="week">What week would you like to start?</label>
  <input id="week" type="week" name="week"
         min="2017-W01" max="2017-W52">
  <span class="validity"></span>
</form>
```


<iframe src='https://mdn.mozillademos.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/week$samples/Setting_maximum_and_minimum_weeks?revision=1392199' width='600' height='40'></iframe>




Here&#39;s the CSS used in the above example. Here we make use of the[`:valid`]34532 "The :valid CSS pseudo-class represents any <input> or other <form> element whose contents validate successfully. This allows to easily make valid fields adopt an appearance that helps the user confirm that their data is formatted properly.")and[`:invalid`]34512 "The :invalid CSS pseudo-class represents any <input> or other <form> element whose contents fail to validate.")CSS properties to style the input based on whether or not the current value is valid. We had to put the icons on a[`<span>`]13247 "The HTML <span> element is a generic inline container for phrasing content, which does not inherently represent anything. It can be used to group elements for styling purposes (using the class or id attributes), or because they share attribute values, such as lang.")next to the input, not on the input itself, because in Chrome the generated content is placed inside the form control, and can&#39;t be styled or shown effectively.


```
div {
  margin-bottom: 10px;
  position: relative;
}

input[type="number"] {
  width: 100px;
}

input + span {
  padding-right: 30px;
}

input:invalid+span:after {
  position: absolute;
  content: '✖';
  padding-left: 5px;
}

input:valid+span:after {
  position: absolute;
  content: '✓';
  padding-left: 5px;
}
```


The result here is that only weeks between W01 and W52 in 2017 will be seen as valid and be selectable in supporting browsers.


### Making week values required<a name="Making_week_values_required"></a>


In addition you can use the`[required]38131 "")`attribute to make filling in the week mandatory. As a result, supporting browsers will display an error if you try to submit an empty week field.



Let&#39;s look at an example; here we&#39;ve set minimum and maximum weeks, and also made the field required:


```
<form>
  <div>
    <label for="week">What week would you like to start?</label>
    <input id="week" type="week" name="week"
         min="2017-W01" max="2017-W52" required>
    <span class="validity"></span> 
  </div>
  <div>
      <input type="submit" value="Submit form">
  </div>
</form>
```


If you try to submit the form with no value, the browser displays an error. Try playing with the example now:



<iframe src='https://mdn.mozillademos.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/week$samples/Making_week_values_required?revision=1392199' width='600' height='120'></iframe>




Here&#39;s&#39;a screenshot for those of you who aren&#39;t using a supporting browser:



![](%40119.png "")



**Important**: HTML form validation is*not*a substitute for scripts that ensure that the entered data is in the proper format. It&#39;s far too easy for someone to make adjustments to the HTML that allow them to bypass the validation, or to remove it entirely. It&#39;s also possible for someone to simply bypass your HTML entirely and submit the data directly to your server. If your server-side code fails to validate the data it receives, disaster could strike when improperly-formatted data is submitted (or data which is too large, of the wrong type, and so forth).



## Handling browser support<a name="Handling_browser_support"></a>


As mentioned above, the major problem with using week inputs right now is browser support: Safari and Firefox don&#39;t support it on desktop, and old versions of IE don&#39;t support it.



Mobile platforms such as Android and iOS make really good use of such input types, providing specialist UI controls that make it really easy to select values in a touchscreen environment. For example, the`week`picker on Chrome for Android looks like this:



![](%40118.png "")



Non-supporting browsers gracefully degrade to a text input, but this creates problems both in terms of consistency of user interface (the presented control will be different), and data handling.



The second problem is the more serious. As mentioned earlier, with a`week`input the actual value is always normalized to the format`yyyy-Www`. When the browser falls back to a generic text input, there&#39;s nothing to guide the user toward correctly formatting the input (and it&#39;s certainly not intuitive). There are multiple ways in which people could write week values; for example:


* `Week 1 2017`
* `Jan 2-8 2017`
* `2017-W01`
* etc.


The best way to deal with week/years in forms in a cross-browser way at the moment is to get the user to enter the week number and year in separate controls ([`<select>`]18852 "The HTML <select> element represents a control that provides a menu of options:")elements being popular; see below for an example), or use JavaScript libraries such as[jQuery date picker]39924 "").


## Examples<a name="Examples"></a>


In this example we create two sets of UI elements for choosing weeks: a native picker created using`<input type="week">`, and a set of two[`<select>`]18852 "The HTML <select> element represents a control that provides a menu of options:")elements for choosing weeks/years in older browsers that don&#39;t support the`week`input type.



<iframe src='https://mdn.mozillademos.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/week$samples/Examples?revision=1392199' width='600' height='140'></iframe>




The HTML looks like so:


```
<form>
  <div class="nativeWeekPicker">
    <label for="week">What week would you like to start?</label>
    <input id="week" type="week" name="week"
           min="2017-W01" max="2018-W52" required>
    <span class="validity"></span>
  </div>
  <p class="fallbackLabel">What week would you like to start?</p>
  <div class="fallbackWeekPicker">
    <div>
      <span>
        <label for="week">Week:</label>
        <select id="fallbackWeek" name="week">
        </select>
      </span>
      <span>
        <label for="year">Year:</label>
        <select id="year" name="year">
          <option value="2017" selected>2017</option>
          <option value="2018">2018</option>
        </select>
      </span>
    </div>
  </div>
</form>
```


The week values are dynamically generated by the JavaScript code below.



The other part of the code that may be of interest is the feature detection code. To detect whether the browser supports`<input type="week">`, we create a new[`<input>`]17158 "The HTML <input> element is used to create interactive controls for web-based forms in order to accept data from the user.")element, set its`type`to`week`, then immediately check what its`type`is set to. Non-supporting browsers will return`text`, because the`week`type falls back to type`text`. If`<input type="week">`is not supported, we hide the native picker and show the fallback picker UI ([`<select>`]18852 "The HTML <select> element represents a control that provides a menu of options:")s) instead.


```
// define variables
var nativePicker = document.querySelector('.nativeWeekPicker');
var fallbackPicker = document.querySelector('.fallbackWeekPicker');
var fallbackLabel = document.querySelector('.fallbackLabel');

var yearSelect = document.querySelector('#year');
var weekSelect = document.querySelector('#fallbackWeek');

// hide fallback initially
fallbackPicker.style.display = 'none';
fallbackLabel.style.display = 'none';

// test whether a new date input falls back to a text input or not
var test = document.createElement('input');
test.type = 'week';
// if it does, run the code inside the if() {} block
if(test.type === 'text') {
  // hide the native picker and show the fallback
  nativePicker.style.display = 'none';
  fallbackPicker.style.display = 'block';
  fallbackLabel.style.display = 'block';

  // populate the weeks dynamically
  populateWeeks();
}

function populateWeeks() {
  // Populate the week select with 52 weeks
  for(var i = 1; i <= 52; i++) {
    var option = document.createElement('option');
    option.textContent = (i < 10) ? ("0" + i) : i;
    weekSelect.appendChild(option);
  }
}
```


**Note**: Remember that some years have 53 weeks in them (see[Weeks per year]39925 ""))! You&#39;ll need to take this into consideration when developing production apps.
