SIMD.js has been[taken out of active development in TC39]41628 "")and removed from Stage 3. It is not being pursued by web browsers for implementation anymore. SIMD operations exposed to the web are under active development within[WebAssembly]21620 ""), with operations based on the SIMD.js operations.



The**`SIMD.Float32x4`**data type is a 128-bit vector divided into 4 lanes storing single precision floating point values.

## Syntax<a name="Syntax"></a>

```
SIMD.Float32x4(x, y, z, w);
```

### Parameters<a name="Parameters"></a>


The input values are specified in double precision floating and are converted to single precision floating point values before being stored.

<dl><dt id=''>`x`Optional</dt><dd>A double specifying the value of the first lane. Defaults to[`NaN`]22328 "The global NaN property is a value representing Not-A-Number.").</dd><dt id=''>`y`Optional</dt><dd>A double specifying the value of the second lane. Defaults to[`NaN`]22328 "The global NaN property is a value representing Not-A-Number.").</dd><dt id=''>`z`Optional</dt><dd>A double specifying the value of the third lane. Defaults to[`NaN`]22328 "The global NaN property is a value representing Not-A-Number.").</dd><dt id=''>`w`Optional</dt><dd>A double specifying the value of the fourth lane. Defaults to[`NaN`]22328 "The global NaN property is a value representing Not-A-Number.").</dd></dl>
## Constructor functions<a name="Constructor_functions"></a>


In addition to the simple creator functions, the SIMD API provides the following constructor function. Note that you can also[convert from another SIMD data type to Float32x4](%40546#Data_conversions "").

<dl><dt id=''>[`SIMD.Float32x4.splat()`]42564 "SIMD.js has been taken out of active development in TC39 and removed from Stage 3. It is not being pursued by web browsers for implementation anymore. SIMD operations exposed to the web are under active development within WebAssembly, with operations based on the SIMD.js operations.")</dt><dd>Creates an Float32x4 with all lanes set to a given value.</dd></dl>

**Note:**SIMD types don&#39;t work with`new`, as SIMD values are no &quot;boxed&quot; objects (comparable to`String(s)`vs.`new String(s)`, which creates a String object).


```
var v = new SIMD.Float32x4(0, 1, 2, 3); 
// TypeError: SIMD.Float32x4 is not a constructor
var w = new SIMD.Float32x4.splat(3); 
// TypeError: SIMD.Float32x4.splat is not a constructor
```


Instead, you just write:


```
var v = SIMD.Float32x4(0, 1, 2, 3);
var w = SIMD.Float32x4.splat(3);
```


## Operations<a name="Operations"></a>


To actually do something with SIMD types, SIMD operations are needed that work on SIMD data types.
