SIMD.js has been[taken out of active development in TC39]41628 "")and removed from Stage 3. It is not being pursued by web browsers for implementation anymore. SIMD operations exposed to the web are under active development within[WebAssembly]21620 ""), with operations based on the SIMD.js operations.



The static**`SIMD.%type%.lessThan()`**method returns a selection mask with values depending on a less-than comparison (`a < b`) in each lane.


## Syntax<a name="Syntax"></a>

```
SIMD.Float32x4.lessThan(a, b)
SIMD.Float64x2.lessThan(a, b)

SIMD.Int8x16.lessThan(a, b)
SIMD.Int16x8.lessThan(a, b)
SIMD.Int32x4.lessThan(a, b)

SIMD.Uint8x16.lessThan(a, b) 
SIMD.Uint16x8.lessThan(a, b)
SIMD.Uint32x4.lessThan(a, b) 

```

### Parameters<a name="Parameters"></a>
<dl><dt id=''>a</dt><dd>An instance of a SIMD type.</dd><dt id=''>`b`</dt><dd>Another instance of a SIMD type.</dd></dl>
### Return value<a name="Return_value"></a>


A selection mask (of type`Bool64x2`,`Bool32x4`,`Bool16x8`or`Bool8x16`depending on the size). The lane values of the mask are either`true`or`false`depending on the result of`a < b`.


## Description<a name="Description"></a>


The`SIMD.%type%.lessThan`method is one of the SIMD[comparison operations]41631 "")and does not give you back the values of the less-than comparison of two instances directly. Instead, a selection mask with Boolean values is returned.


## Examples<a name="Examples"></a>

### Selecting the smallest lane values from two vectors<a name="Selecting_the_smallest_lane_values_from_two_vectors"></a>


In this example, two SIMD`Float32x4`data types are compared to find the smallest value for each lane and a selection mask gets created based on the result. This selection mask is then used to select the smallest values of both vectors into a new`Float32x4`vector.


```
var a = SIMD.Float32x4(1, 2, 3, 11);
var b = SIMD.Float32x4(1, 4, 7, 9);

var mask = SIMD.Float32x4.lessThan(a, b);
// Bool32x4[false, true, true, false]

var result = SIMD.Float32x4.select(mask, a, b);
// Float32x4[1, 2, 3, 9]
```

## Browser compatibility<a name="Browser_compatibility"></a>


Experimental SIMD.js has been removed from browsers. It&#39;s still available in Firefox Nightly, but will be removed in favor of a SIMD implementation in[WebAssembly]21620 ""). See also[bug 1416723]42510 "Consider removing SIMD.js?").
