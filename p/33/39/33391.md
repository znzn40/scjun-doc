**Non-standard**<br></br>This feature is non-standard and is not on a standards track. Do not use it on production sites facing the Web: it will not work for every user. There may also be large incompatibilities between implementations and the behavior may change in the future.






The**`::-ms-ticks-after`**[CSS]427 "")[pseudo-element]3563 "")is a[Microsoft extension]28320 "")that applies one or more styles to the tick marks that appear after the track of a slider control. A slider control is one possible representation of[&lt;input type=&quot;range&quot;&gt;]37447 "").



These ticks are not shown by default. To show them, set the control&#39;s[`display`]30836 "The display CSS property specifies the type of rendering box used for an element. In HTML, default display property values are taken from behaviors described in the HTML specifications or from the browser/user default stylesheet. The default value in XML is inline, including SVG elements.")property to`block`.



It is possible to use the**`::-ms-ticks-after`**,[`::-ms-ticks-before`]33392 "The ::-ms-ticks-before CSS pseudo-element is a Microsoft extension that applies one or more styles to the tick marks that appear before the track of a slider control. A slider control is one possible representation of <input type="range">."), and[`::-ms-track`]33394 "The ::-ms-track CSS pseudo-element is a Microsoft extension that represents the track of a slider control. A slider control is one possible representation of <input type="range">.")pseudo-elements together. To do so would create three sets of tick marks, but the best user experience is one set. To remove tick marks altogether, set the[`color`]28820 "The color CSS property sets the foreground color value of an element's text content and text decorations. It also sets the currentcolor value, which may be used as an indirect value on other properties, and is the default for other color properties, such as border-color.")property to`transparent`.
