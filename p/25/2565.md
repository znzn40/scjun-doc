The**`BlobEvent`**interface represents events associated with a[`Blob`](%4167 "A Blob object represents a file-like object of immutable, raw data. Blobs represent data that isn't necessarily in a JavaScript-native format. The File interface is based on Blob, inheriting blob functionality and expanding it to support files on the user's system."). These blobs are typically, but not necessarily, associated with media content.
