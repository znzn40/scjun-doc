**Non-standard**<br></br>This feature is non-standard and is not on a standards track. Do not use it on production sites facing the Web: it will not work for every user. There may also be large incompatibilities between implementations and the behavior may change in the future.





The**`:-moz-submit-invalid`**CSS[pseudo-class]29799 "Pseudo-classes")is a[Mozilla extension]28318 "")that represents any submit[`<button>`]23957 "The HTML <button> element represents a clickable button, which can be used in forms, or anywhere in a document that needs simple, standard button functionality.")on forms whose contents aren&#39;t valid based on their[validation constraints]35058 "en/HTML/HTML5/Forms in HTML5#Constraint Validation").



By default, no style is applied. You can use this pseudo-class to customize the appearance of the submit button when there are invalid form fields.
