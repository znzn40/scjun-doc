The**stacking context**is a three-dimensional conceptualization of HTML elements along an imaginary z-axis relative to the user, who is assumed to be facing the viewport or the webpage. HTML elements occupy this space in priority order based on element attributes.


## The stacking context<a name="The_stacking_context"></a>


In the previous part of this article,[Using z-index](%35203 "Adding z-index"), the rendering order of certain elements is influenced by their`z-index`value. This occurs because these elements have special properties which cause them to form a*stacking context*.



A stacking context is formed, anywhere in the document, by any element in the following scenarios:


* Root element of document (HTML).
* Element with a[`position`](%34283 "The position CSS property specifies how an element is positioned in a document. The top, right, bottom, and left properties determine the final location of positioned elements.")value &quot;absolute&quot; or &quot;relative&quot; and[`z-index`](%33507 "The z-index CSS property specifies the z-order of a positioned element and its descendants. When elements overlap, z-order determines which one covers the other. An element with a larger z-index generally covers an element with a lower one.")value other than &quot;auto&quot;.
* Element with a[`position`](%34283 "The position CSS property specifies how an element is positioned in a document. The top, right, bottom, and left properties determine the final location of positioned elements.")value &quot;fixed&quot; or &quot;sticky&quot; (sticky for all mobile browsers, but not older desktop).
* Element that is a child of a flex ([`flexbox`](%35204 "REDIRECT /en-US/docs/CSS/Using_CSS_flexible_boxes")) container, with[`z-index`](%33507 "The z-index CSS property specifies the z-order of a positioned element and its descendants. When elements overlap, z-order determines which one covers the other. An element with a larger z-index generally covers an element with a lower one.")value other than &quot;auto&quot;.
* Element with a[`opacity`](%31319 "The opacity CSS property specifies the level of transparency of an element, that is, the degree to which the content behind the element is visible.")value less than 1 (See[the specification for opacity](%35205 "http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-color/#transparency")).
* Element with a[`mix-blend-mode`](%33428 "The mix-blend-mode CSS property describes how an element's content should blend with the content of the element's direct parent and the element's background.")value other than &quot;normal&quot;.
* Element with any of the following properties with value other than &quot;none&quot;:
	* [`transform`](%6321 "The transform CSS property lets you rotate, scale, skew, orÂ translate a given element. This is achieved by modifying the coordinate space of the CSS visual formatting model.")
	* [`filter`](%23741 "The filter CSS property lets you apply graphical effects like blurring or color shifting to an element. Filters are commonly used to adjust the rendering of images, backgrounds, and borders.")
	* [`perspective`](%33006 "The perspective CSS property determines the distance between the z=0 plane and the user in order to give a 3D-positioned element some perspective. Each 3D element with z>0 becomes larger; each 3D-element with z<0 becomes smaller. The strength of the effect is determined by the value of this property.")
	* [`clip-path`](%29240 "The clip-path CSS property creates a clipping region that defines what part of an element should be displayed. More specifically, those portions that are inside the region are shown, while those outside are hidden.")
	* [`mask`](%30986 "The mask CSS property alters the visibility of an element by either partially or fully hiding it. This is accomplished by either masking or clipping the image at specific points.")/[`mask-image`](%30956 "The mask-image CSS property sets the image that is used as mask layer for an element.")/[`mask-border`](%35190 "The mask-border CSS property lets you create a mask along the edge of an element's border.")
* Element with a[`isolation`](%35206 "The isolation CSS property determines whether an element must create a new stacking context.")value &quot;isolate&quot;.
* Element with a[`-webkit-overflow-scrolling`](%33222 "The -webkit-overflow-scrolling CSS property controls whether or not touch devices use momentum-based scrolling for a given element.")value &quot;touch&quot;.
* Element with a[`will-change`](%33461 "The will-change CSS property provides a way for authors to hint browsers about the kind of changes to be expected on an element, so that the browser can set up appropriate optimizations ahead of time before the element is actually changed.")value specifying any property that would create a stacking context on non-initial value (see[this post](%35207 "")).


Within a stacking context, child elements are stacked according to the same rules previously explained. Importantly, the z-index values of its child stacking contexts only have meaning in this parent. Stacking contexts are treated atomically as a single unit in the parent stacking context.



In summary:


* Stacking contexts can be contained in other stacking contexts, and together create a hierarchy of stacking contexts.
* Each stacking context is completely independent from its siblings: only descendant elements are considered when stacking is processed.
* Each stacking context is self-contained: after the element&#39;s contents are stacked, the whole element is considered in the stacking order of the parent stacking context.
**Note:**The hierarchy of stacking contexts is a subset of the hierarchy of HTML elements, because only certain elements create stacking contexts. We can say that elements that do not create their own stacking contexts are*assimilated*by the parent stacking context.

## **The example**<a name="The_example"></a>


![Example of stacking rules modified using z-index](%35208 "")



In this example every positioned element creates its own stacking context, because of their positioning and z-index values. The hierarchy of stacking contexts is organized as follows:


* Root
	* DIV #1
	* DIV #2
	* DIV #3
		* DIV #4
		* DIV #5
		* DIV #6


It is important to note that DIV #4, DIV #5 and DIV #6 are children of DIV #3, so stacking of those elements is completely resolved within DIV#3. Once stacking and rendering within DIV #3 is completed, the whole DIV #3 element is passed for stacking in the root element with respect to its sibling&#39;s DIV.



**Notes:**


* DIV #4 is rendered under DIV #1 because DIV #1&#39;s z-index (5) is valid within the stacking context of the root element, while DIV #4&#39;s z-index (6) is valid within the stacking context of DIV #3. So, DIV #4 is under DIV #1, because DIV #4 belongs to DIV #3, which has a lower z-index value.
* For the same reason DIV #2 (z-index 2) is rendered under DIV#5 (z-index 1) because DIV #5 belongs to DIV #3, which has an higher z-index value.
* DIV #3&#39;s z-index is 4, but this value is independent from z-index of DIV #4, DIV #5 and DIV #6, because it belongs to a different stacking context.
* An easy way to figure out the*rendering order*of stacked elements along the Z axis is to think of it as a &quot;version number&quot; of sorts, where child elements are minor version numbers underneath their parent&#39;s major version numbers. This way we can easily see how an element with a z-index of 1 (DIV #5) is stacked above an element with a z-index of 2 (DIV #2), and how an element with a z-index of 6 (DIV #4) is stacked below an element with a z-index of 5 (DIV #1). In our example (sorted according to the final rendering order):
	* Root
		* DIV #2 - z-index is 2
		* DIV #3 - z-index is 4
			* DIV #5 - z-index is 1, stacked under an element with a z-index of 4, which results in a rendering order of 4.1
			* DIV #6 - z-index is 3, stacked under an element with a z-index of 4, which results in a rendering order of 4.3
			* DIV #4 - z-index is 6, stacked under an element with a z-index of 4, which results in a rendering order of 4.6
		* DIV #1 - z-index is 5
