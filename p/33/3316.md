The**`WorkerLocation`**interface defines the absolute location of the script executed by the[`Worker`](%4847 "The Worker interface of the Web Workers API represents a background task that can be easily created and can send messages back to its creator. Creating a worker is as simple as calling the Worker() constructor and specifying a script to be run in the worker thread."). Such an object is initialized for each worker and is available via the[`WorkerGlobalScope.location`](%21522 "The location read-only property of the WorkerGlobalScope interface returns the WorkerLocation associated with the worker. It is a specific location object, mostly a subset of the Location for browsing scopes, but adapted to workers.")property obtained by calling`self.location`.



This interface is only visible from inside a JavaScript script executed in the context of a Web worker.
