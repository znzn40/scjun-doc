The**`ConstrainDouble`**type is used to specify a constraint for a property whose value is a double-precision floating-point number. It extends the[`DoubleRange`](%5066 "The DoubleRange dictionary is used to define a range of permitted double-precision floating-point values for a property, with either or both a maximum and minimum value specified. The ConstrainDouble dictionary is based on this, augmenting it to support exact and ideal values as well.")dictionary (which provides the ability to specify a permitted range of property values) to also support an exact value and/or an ideal value the property should take on. Additionally, you can specify the property&#39;s value as a simple floating-point value, in which case the user agent does its best to match the value once all other more stringent constraints are met.

<em>If the value of a`ConstrainDouble`is an object rather than a number, it may have the properties below in addition the properties it inherits from[`DoubleRange`](%5066 "The DoubleRange dictionary is used to define a range of permitted double-precision floating-point values for a property, with either or both a maximum and minimum value specified. The ConstrainDouble dictionary is based on this, augmenting it to support exact and ideal values as well.").</em>

Technically,`ConstrainDouble`is actually based on an intermediary dictionary named`ConstrainDoubleRange`, which adds`exact`and`ideal`to[`DoubleRange`](%5066 "The DoubleRange dictionary is used to define a range of permitted double-precision floating-point values for a property, with either or both a maximum and minimum value specified. The ConstrainDouble dictionary is based on this, augmenting it to support exact and ideal values as well."), with`ConstrainDouble`being a type that can be either a long integer or a`DoubleRange`. However, for the sake of documentation clarity, the intermediate type (present only because of quirks in[WebIDL](%5048 "WebIDL: WebIDL is the interface description language used to describe the data types, interfaces, methods, properties, and other components which make up a Web application programming interface (API). It uses a somewhat stylized syntax which is independent of any specific programming language, so that the underlying code which is used to build each API can be written in whatever language is most appropriate, while still being possible to map the API's components to JavaScript-compatible constructs.")syntax) is ignored here.
