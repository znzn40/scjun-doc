**Non-standard**<br></br>This feature is non-standard and is not on a standards track. Do not use it on production sites facing the Web: it will not work for every user. There may also be large incompatibilities between implementations and the behavior may change in the future.





The**`FileSystemEntry`**interface of the File and Directory Entries API represents a single in a file system. The entry can be a file or a directory (directories are represented by the[`DirectoryEntry`]11171 "The documentation about this has not yet been written; please consider contributing!")interface). It includes methods for working with files—including copying, moving, removing, and reading files—as well as information about a file it points to—including the file name and its path from the root to the entry.



Because this is a non-standard API, whose specification is not currently on a standards track, it&#39;s important to keep in mind that not all browsers implement it, and those that do may implement only small portions of it. Check the[Browser compatibility](%2712#Browser_compatibility "")section for details.



## Basic concepts<a name="basic"></a>


You don&#39;t create`FileSystemEntry`objects directly. Instead, you will receive an object based on this interface through other APIs. This interface serves as a base class for the[`FileSystemFileEntry`]11160 "The FileSystemFileEntry interface of the File System API represents a file in a file system. It offers properties describing the file's attributes, as well as the file() method, which creates a File object that can be used to read the file.")and[`FileSystemDirectoryEntry`]11161 "The FileSystemDirectoryEntry interface of the File and Directory Entries API represents a directory in a file system. It provides methods which make it possible to access and manipulate the files in a directory, as well as to access the entries within the directory.")interfaces, which provide features specific to file system entries representing files and directories, respectively.



The`FileSystemEntry`interface includes methods that you would expect for manipulating files and directories, but it also includes a convenient method for obtaining the URL of the entry:`[toURL()]11173 "")`. It also introduces a new URL scheme:`filesystem:`.



You can use the`filesystem:`scheme on Google Chrome to see all the files and folders that are stored in the origin of your app. Just use`filesystem:`scheme for the root directory of the origin of the app. For example, if your app is in`[http://www.html5rocks.com]11174 "")`, open`filesystem:[http://www.html5rocks.com/temporary/]10430 "")`in a tab. Chrome shows a read-only list of all the files and folders stored the origin of your app.


### Example<a name="example"></a>


To see an example of how`toURL()`works, see the[method description]11173 ""). The snippet below shows you how you can remove a file by name.


```
// Taking care of the browser-specific prefixes.
window.requestFileSystem  = window.requestFileSystem || window.webkitRequestFileSystem; 

...

// Opening a file system with temporary storage
window.requestFileSystem(TEMPORARY, 1024*1024 /*1MB*/, function(fs) {
  fs.root.getFile('log.txt', {}, function(fileEntry) {
    
    fileEntry.remove(function() {
      console.log('File removed.');
    }, onError);
  
  }, onError);
}, onError);
```
