The**`MediaTrackSettings`**dictionary is used to return the current values configured for each of a[`MediaStreamTrack`](%14022 "The MediaStreamTrack interface represents a single media track within a stream; typically, these are audio or video tracks, but other track types may exist as well.")&#39;s settings. These values will adhere as closely as possible to any constraints previously described using a[`MediaTrackConstraints`](%5051 "The MediaTrackConstraints dictionary is used to describe a set of capabilities and the value or values each can take on. A constraints dictionary is passed into applyConstraints() to allow a script to establish a set of exact (required) values or ranges and/or preferred values or ranges of values for the track, and the most recently-requested set of custom constraints can be retrieved by calling getConstraints().")object and set using[`applyConstraints()`](%14986 "The applyConstraints() method of the MediaStreamTrack interface applies a set of constraints to the track; these constraints let the Web site or app establish ideal values and acceptable ranges of values for the constrainable properties of the track, such as frame rate, dimensions, echo cancelation, and so forth."), and will adhere to the default constraints for any properties whose constraints haven&#39;t been changed, or whose customized constraints couldn&#39;t be matched.

Some or all of the following will be included in the object.


### Properties of all media tracks<a name="Properties_of_all_media_tracks"></a>
<dl><dt>[`deviceId`](%15072 "The MediaTrackSettings dictionary's deviceId property is a DOMString which uniquely identifies the source for the corresponding MediaStreamTrack for the origin corresponding to the browsing session. This lets you determine what value was selected to comply with your specified constraints for this property's value as described in the MediaTrackConstraints.deviceId property you provided when calling either getUserMedia().")</dt><dd>A[`DOMString`](%3945 "DOMString is a UTF-16 String. As JavaScript already uses such strings, DOMString is mapped directly to a String.")indicating the current value of the`[`deviceId`](%15073 "The MediaTrackConstraints dictionary's deviceId property is a ConstrainDOMString describing the requested or mandatory constraints placed upon the value of the deviceId constrainable property.")`property. The device ID is a origin-unique string identifying the source of the track; this is usually a[GUID](%15074 "The definition of that term (GUID) has not been written yet; please consider contributing it!"). This value is specific to the source of the track&#39;s data and is not usable for setting constraints; it can, however, be used for initially selecting media when calling[`MediaDevices.getUserMedia()`](%14533 "The MediaDevices getUserMedia() method prompts the user for permission to use a media input which produces a MediaStream with tracks containing the requested types of media.").</dd><dt>[`groupId`](%15075 "The MediaTrackSettings dictionary's groupId property is a browsing-session unique DOMString which identifies the group of devices which includes the source for the MediaStreamTrack. This lets you determine what value was selected to comply with your specified constraints for this property's value as described in the MediaTrackConstraints.groupId property you provided when calling either getUserMedia().")</dt><dd>A[`DOMString`](%3945 "DOMString is a UTF-16 String.

The group ID is a browsing session-unique string identifying the source group of the track. Two devices (as identified by the[`deviceId`](%15072 "The MediaTrackSettings dictionary's deviceId property is a DOMString which uniquely identifies the source for the corresponding MediaStreamTrack for the origin corresponding to the browsing session. This lets you determine what value was selected to comply with your specified constraints for this property's value as described in the MediaTrackConstraints.deviceId property you provided when calling either getUserMedia().")) are considered part of the same group if they are from the same physical device. For instance, the audio input and output devices for the speaker and microphone built into a phone would share the same group ID, since they&#39;re part of the same physical device. The microphone on a headset would have a different ID, though. This value is specific to the source of the track&#39;s data and is not usable for setting constraints; it can, however, be used for initially selecting media when calling[`MediaDevices.getUserMedia()`](%14533 "The MediaDevices getUserMedia() method prompts the user for permission to use a media input which produces a MediaStream with tracks containing the requested types of media.").</dd></dl>

Latency is the amount of time which elapses between the start of processing the audio and the data being available to the next stop in the audio utilization process. This value is a target value; actual latency may vary to some extent for various reasons.</dd><dt>[`noiseSuppression`](%15085 "The MediaTrackSettings dictionary's noiseSuppression property is a Boolean value whose value indicates whether or not noise suppression technology is enabled on an audio track. This lets you determine what value was selected to comply with your specified constraints for this property's value as described in the MediaTrackConstraints.noiseSuppression property you provided when calling either getUserMedia() or MediaStreamTrack.applyConstraints().")</dt><dd>A Boolean which indicates the current value of the[`noiseSupression`](%15086 "The MediaTrackConstraints dictionary's noiseSuppression property is a ConstrainBoolean describing the requested or mandatory constraints placed upon the value of the noiseSuppression constrainable property.")property, which is`true`if noise suppression is enabled and is`false`otherwise.</dd></dl><dl><dt>[`sampleRate`](%15087 "The MediaTrackSettings dictionary's sampleRate property is an integer indicating how many audio samples per second the MediaStreamTrack is currently configured for.

Standard CD-quality audio, for example, has a sample rate of 41,000 samples per second.</dd><dt>[`sampleSize`](%15089 "The MediaTrackSettings dictionary's sampleSize property is an integer indicating the linear sample size (in bits per sample) the MediaStreamTrack is currently configured for. This lets you determine what value was selected to comply with your specified constraints for this property's value as described in the MediaTrackConstraints.sampleSize property you provided when calling either getUserMedia() or MediaStreamTrack.applyConstraints().")</dt><dd>A long integer value indicating the current value of the`[`sampleSize`](%15090 "The MediaTrackConstraints dictionary's sampleSize property is a ConstrainLong describing the requested or mandatory constraints placed upon the value of the sampleSize constrainable property.")`property, specifying the linear size, in bits, of each audio sample. CD-quality audio, for example, is 16-bit, so this value would be 16 in that case.</dd><dt>[`volume`](%15091 "The MediaTrackSettings dictionary's volume property is a double-precision floating-point number indicating the volume of the MediaStreamTrack as currently configured, as a value from 0.0 (silence) to 1.0 (maximum supported volume for the device).
