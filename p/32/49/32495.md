The**`unicode-range`**CSS descriptor sets the specific range of characters to be used from a font defined by[`@font-face`](%26965 "The @font-face CSS at-rule allows authors to specify fonts (online url(), and locally local()), to display text on their web pages. By allowing authors to provide their own fonts, @font-face eliminates the need to depend on the limited number of fonts users have installed on their computers. By allowing authors to access users fonts, @font-face eliminates the dependencies of having internet access, as well as downloading the font's resources locally. These seemingly contrasting options empower developers to take advantage of the users settings in order to provide a seamless typographical experience. The @font-face at-rule may be used not only at the top level of a CSS, but also inside any CSS conditional-group at-rule.")and made available for use on the current page. If the page doesn&#39;t use any character in this range, the font is not downloaded; if it uses at least one, the whole font is downloaded.



The purpose of this descriptor is to allow the font resources to be segmented so that a browser only needs to download the font resource needed for the text content of a particular page. For example, a site with many localizations could provide separate font resources for English, Greek and Japanese. For users viewing the English version of a page, the font resources for Greek and Japanese fonts wouldn&#39;t need to be downloaded, saving bandwidth.

We create a simple HTML containing a single[`<div>`](%24289 "The HTML Content Division element (<div>) is the generic container for flow content. It has no effect on the content or layout until styled using CSS.")element, including an ampersand, that we want to style with a different font. To make it obvious, we will use a sans-serif font,*Helvetica*, for the text, and a serif font,*Times New Roman*, for the ampersand.


```
<div>Me & You = Us</div>
```



In the CSS, you can see that we are in effect defining a completely separate[`@font-face`](%26965 "The @font-face CSS at-rule allows authors to specify fonts (online url(), and locally local()), to display text on their web pages. By allowing authors to provide their own fonts, @font-face eliminates the need to depend on the limited number of fonts users have installed on their computers. By allowing authors to access users fonts, @font-face eliminates the dependencies of having internet access, as well as downloading the font's resources locally. These seemingly contrasting options empower developers to take advantage of the users settings in order to provide a seamless typographical experience. The @font-face at-rule may be used not only at the top level of a CSS, but also inside any CSS conditional-group at-rule.")that only includes a single character in it, meaning that only this character will be styled with this font. We could also have done this by wrapping the ampersand in a[`<span>`](%13247 "The HTML <span> element is a generic inline container for phrasing content, which does not inherently represent anything. It can be used to group elements for styling purposes (using the class or id attributes), or because they share attribute values, such as lang.")and applying a different font just to that, but that is an extra element and rule set.


```
@font-face {
  font-family: 'Ampersand';
  src: local('Times New Roman');
  unicode-range: U+26;
}

div {
  font-size: 4em;
  font-family: Ampersand, Helvetica, sans-serif;	
}
```
