## [](%5374#_name "")NAME<a name="_name"></a>


git-merge-index - Run a merge for files needing merging





## [](%5374#_synopsis "")SYNOPSIS<a name="_synopsis"></a>

```
git merge-index [-o] [-q] <merge-program> (-a | [--] <file>*)
```




## [](%5374#_description "")DESCRIPTION<a name="_description"></a>


This looks up the &lt;file&gt;(s) in the index and, if there are any merge entries, passes the SHA-1 hash for those files as arguments 1, 2, 3 (empty argument if no file), and &lt;file&gt; as argument 4. File modes for the three files are passed as arguments 5, 6 and 7.





## [](%5374#_options "")OPTIONS<a name="_options"></a>
<dl><dt id='git-merge-index---'>[](%5374#git-merge-index--- "")--</dt><dd>

Do not interpret any more arguments as options.

</dd><dt id='git-merge-index--a'>[](%5374#git-merge-index--a "")-a</dt><dd>

Run merge against all files in the index that need merging.

</dd><dt id='git-merge-index--o'>[](%5374#git-merge-index--o "")-o</dt><dd>

Instead of stopping at the first failed merge, do all of them in one shot - continue with merging even when previous merges returned errors, and only return the error code after all the merges.

</dd><dt id='git-merge-index--q'>[](%5374#git-merge-index--q "")-q</dt><dd>

Do not complain about a failed merge program (a merge program failure usually indicates conflicts during the merge). This is for porcelains which might want to emit custom messages.

If<em>git merge-index</em>is called with multiple &lt;file&gt;s (or -a) then it processes them in turn only stopping if merge returns a non-zero exit code.




Typically this is run with a script calling Git’s imitation of the<em>merge</em>command from the RCS package.




A sample script called<em>git merge-one-file</em>is included in the distribution.




ALERT ALERT ALERT! The Git &quot;merge object order&quot; is different from the RCS<em>merge</em>program merge object order. In the above ordering, the original is first. But the argument order to the 3-way merge program<em>merge</em>is to have the original in the middle. Don’t ask me why.




Examples:



```
torvalds@ppc970:~/merge-test> git merge-index cat MM
This is MM from the original tree.			# original
This is modified MM in the branch A.			# merge1
This is modified MM in the branch B.			# merge2
This is modified MM in the branch B.			# current contents
```




or



```
torvalds@ppc970:~/merge-test> git merge-index cat AA MM
cat: : No such file or directory
This is added AA in the branch A.
This is added AA in the branch B.
This is added AA in the branch B.
fatal: merge program failed
```




where the latter example shows how<em>git merge-index</em>will stop trying to merge once anything has returned an error (i.e.,`cat`returned an error for the AA file, because it didn’t exist in the original, and thus<em>git merge-index</em>didn’t even try to merge the MM thing).
