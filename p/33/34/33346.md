The following table lists the most popular DX Filters and their standards-based alternatives:


DX Filter | Standards-based Alternative 
 ---  |  ---  |

DropShadow | text-shadow or box-shadow

In Windows Internet Explorer 8, the`-ms-filter`attribute is an extension to CSS, and can be used as a synonym for[`filter`]23741 "The filter CSS property lets you apply graphical effects like blurring or color shifting to an element. Filters are commonly used to adjust the rendering of images, backgrounds, and borders.")in IE8 Standards mode. When you use`-ms-filter`, enclose the progid in single quotes (&#39;) or double quotes (&quot;). Use commas (,) to separate multiple values, as shown in the Examples section.



An object must have layout for the filter to render. A simple way to accomplish this is to give the element a specified[`height`]14278 "The height CSS property specifies the height of an element. By default, the property defines the height of the content area. If box-sizing is set to border-box, however, it instead determines the height of the border area.")and[`width`]13333 "The width CSS property specifies the width of an element. By default, the property defines the width of the content area. If box-sizing is set to border-box, however, it instead determines the width of the border area."), or both.



The shadow filter can be applied to the[`<img>`]26829 "The HTML <img> element embeds an image into the document.")object by setting the filter on the image&#39;s parent container.



The filter mechanism is extensible and enables you to develop and add filters later. For more information about filters, see[Introduction to Filters and Transitions]37285 "").
