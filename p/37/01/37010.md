**Non-standard**<br></br>This feature is non-standard and is not on a standards track. Do not use it on production sites facing the Web: it will not work for every user. There may also be large incompatibilities between implementations and the behavior may change in the future.





This is a property of the original CSS Flexible Box Layout Module draft, and has been replaced by a newer standard. See[flexbox](%36179 "")for information about the current standard.



The**`box-ordinal-group`**[CSS](%427 "")property assigns the flexbox&#39;s child elements to an ordinal group.


```
/* <integer> values */
box-ordinal-group: 1;
box-ordinal-group: 5;

/* Global values */
box-ordinal-group: inherit;
box-ordinal-group: initial;
box-ordinal-group: unset;
```


Ordinal groups may be used in conjunction with the[`box-direction`](%36344 "The box-direction CSS property specifies whether a box lays out its contents normally (from the top or left edge), or in reverse (from the bottom or right edge).")property to control the order in which the direct children of a box appear. When the computed`box-direction`is normal, a box will display its elements starting from the lowest numbered ordinal group and ensure that those elements appear to the left (for horizontal boxes) or at the top (for vertical boxes) of the container. Elements with the same ordinal group are flowed in the order they appear in the source document tree. In the reverse direction, the ordinal groups are examined in the same order, except the elements appear reversed.


[Initial value](%28552 "") | `1` 
Applies to | children of box elements 
[Inherited](%28555 "") | no 
Media | visual 
[Computed value](%28556 "") | as specified 
Animation type | discrete 
Canonical order | the unique non-ambiguous order defined by the formal grammar

Since Gecko 49.0 (Firefox 49.0 / Thunderbird 49.0 / SeaMonkey 2.46) the preference defaults to`true`.
