In[CSS]427 ""), a**replaced element**is an element whose representation is outside the scope of CSS; they&#39;re external objects whose representation is independent of the CSS formatting model.



Put in simpler terms, they&#39;re elements whose contents are not affected by the current document&#39;s styles. The position of the replaced element can be affected using CSS, but not the contents of the replaced element itself. Some replaced elements, such as[`<iframe>`]24626 "The HTML Inline Frame element (<iframe>) represents a nested browsing context, effectively embedding another HTML page into the current page.")elements, may have stylesheets of their own, but they don&#39;t inherit the styles of the parent document.



The only other impact CSS can have on a replaced element is that there are properties which support controlling the positioning of the element&#39;s content within its box. See[Controlling object position within the content box](%28752#Controlling_object_position_within_the_content_box "")for further information.


## Replaced elements<a name="Replaced_elements"></a>


Typical replaced elements are:


* [`<iframe>`]24626 "The HTML Inline Frame element (<iframe>) represents a nested browsing context, effectively embedding another HTML page into the current page.")
* [`<video>`]13226 "The HTML Video element (<video>) embeds a media player which supports video playback into the document.")
* [`<embed>`]12384 "The HTML <embed> element embeds external content at the specified point in the document. This content is provided by an external application or other source of interactive content such as a browser plug-in.")
* [`<img>`]26829 "The HTML <img> element embeds an image into the document.")


Some elements are treated as replaced elements only in specific cases:


* [`<option>`]13016 "The HTML <option> element is used to define an item contained in a <select>, an <optgroup>, or a <datalist> element. As such, <option> can represent menu items in popups and other lists of items in an HTML document.")
* [`<audio>`]13227 "The HTML <audio> element is used to embed sound content in documents. It may contain one or more audio sources, represented using the src attribute or the <source> element: the browser will choose the most suitable one. It can also be the destination for streamed media, using a MediaStream.")
* [`<canvas>`]470 "Use the HTML <canvas> element with either the canvas scripting API or the WebGL API to draw graphics and animations.")
* [`<object>`]12937 "The HTML <object> element represents an external resource, which can be treated as an image, a nested browsing context, or a resource to be handled by a plugin.")
* [`<applet>`]33859 "The obsolete HTML Applet Element (<applet>) embeds a Java applet into the document; this element has been deprecated in favor of <object>.")


Some form controls can also be replaced elements. The HTML spec says that an[`<input>`]17158 "The HTML <input> element is used to create interactive controls for web-based forms in order to accept data from the user.")element can be replaced, and[`<input>`]17158 "The HTML <input> element is used to create interactive controls for web-based forms in order to accept data from the user.")elements of the`"image"`type are always replaced elements.



Objects inserted using the CSS[`content`]29555 "The content CSS property is used with the ::before and ::after pseudo-elements to generate content in an element. Objects inserted using the content property are anonymous replaced elements.")property are*anonymous replaced elements*. They are &quot;anonymous&quot; because they don&#39;t exist in the HTML markup.


## Using CSS with replaced elements<a name="Using_CSS_with_replaced_elements"></a>


CSS handles replaced elements specifically in some cases, like when calculating margins and some`auto`values.



Note that some replaced elements, but not all, have intrinsic dimensions or a defined baseline, which is used by some CSS properties, such as[`vertical-align`]13330 "The vertical-align CSS property specifies the vertical alignment of an inline or table-cell box."). Only replaced elements can ever have intrinsic dimensions.


### Controlling object position within the content box<a name="Controlling_object_position_within_the_content_box"></a>


Certain CSS properties can be used to specify how the object contained within the replaced element should be positioned within the element&#39;s box area. These are defined by the[CSS Images Module Level 3]33860 "The 'CSS Images Module Level 3' specification")and[CSS Images Module Level 4]33861 "The 'CSS Images Module Level 4' specification")specifications:

<dl><dt id=''>[`object-fit`]33791 "The object-fit CSS property specifies how the contents of a replaced element, such as an <img> or <video>, should be resized to fit its container.")</dt><dd>Specifies how the replaced element&#39;s content object should be fitted to the containing element&#39;s box.</dd><dt id=''>[`object-position`]31246 "The object-position CSS property specifies the alignment of the selected replaced element's contents within the element's box.")</dt><dd>Specifies the alignment of the replaced element&#39;s content object within the element&#39;s box.</dd></dl>
