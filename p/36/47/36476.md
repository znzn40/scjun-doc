**Media queries**are useful when you want to modify your site or app depending on a device&#39;s general type (such as print vs. screen) or specific characteristics and parameters (such as screen resolution or browser[viewport]14371 "viewport: A viewport represents a polygonal (normally rectangular) area in computer graphics that is currently being viewed. In web browser terms, it refers to the part of the document you're viewing which is currently visible in its window (or the screen, if the document is being viewed in full screen mode). Content outside the viewport is not visible onscreen until scrolled into view.")width).



Media queries are used for the following:


* To conditionally apply styles with the[CSS]427 "")[`@media`]14285 "The @media CSS at-rule can be used to apply part of a style sheet based on the result of one or more media queries.")and[`@import`]33622 "The @import CSS at-rule is used to import style rules from other style sheets.

**Note:**The examples on this page use CSS&#39;s`@media`for illustrative purposes, but the basic syntax remains the same for all types of media queries.



## Syntax<a name="Syntax"></a>


A media query is composed of an optional*media type*and any number of*media feature*expressions. Multiple queries can be combined in various ways by using*logical operators*. Media queries are case-insensitive.



A media query computes to true when the media type (if specified) matches the device on which a document is being displayed*and*all media feature expressions compute as true. Queries involving unknown media types are always false.



**Note:**A style sheet with a media query attached to its[`<link>`]24203 "The HTML <link> element specifies relationships between the current document and an external resource. Possible uses for this element include defining a relational framework for navigation. This element is most used to link to style sheets.")tag[will still download]35043 "")even if the query returns false. Nevertheless, its contents will not apply unless and until the result of the query changes to true.



### Media types<a name="Media_types"></a>


*Media types*describe the general category of a device. Except when using the`not`or`only`logical operators, the media type is optional and the`all`type will be implied.

The`aural`type has been replaced by`speech`, which is similar.

### Media features<a name="Media_features"></a>


*Media features*describe specific characteristics of the[user agent]3517 "user agent: A user agent is a computer program representing a person, for example, a browser in a Web context."), output device, or environment. Media feature expressions test for their presence or value, and are entirely optional. Each media feature expression must be surrounded by parentheses.

### Logical operators<a name="Logical_operators"></a>


The*logical operators*`not`,`and`, and`only`can be used to compose a complex media query. You can also combine multiple media queries into a single rule by separating them with commas.


#### `and`<a name="and"></a>


The`and`operator is used for combining multiple media features together into a single media query, requiring each chained feature to return true in order for the query to be true. It is also used for joining media features with media types.


#### `not`<a name="not"></a>


The`not`operator is used to negate a media query, returning true if the query would otherwise return false. If present in a comma-separated list of queries, it will only negate the specific query to which it is applied. If you use the`not`operator, you*must also*specify a media type.



**Note:**The`not`keyword can&#39;t be used to negate an individual media feature expression, only an entire media query.



#### `only`<a name="only"></a>


The`only`operator is used to apply a style only if an entire query matches, and is useful for preventing older browsers from applying selected styles. If you use the`only`operator, you*must also*specify a media type.


#### `,`(comma)<a name="(comma)"></a>


Commas are used to combine multiple media queries into a single rule. Each query in a comma-separated list is treated separately from the others. Thus, if any of the queries in a list is true, the entire media statement returns true. In other words, lists behave like a logical`or`operator.


## Targeting media types<a name="Targeting_media_types"></a>


Media types describe the general category of a given device. Although websites are commonly designed with screens in mind, you may want to create styles that target special devices such as printers or audio-based screenreaders. For example, this CSS targets printers:


```
@media print { ... }
```


You can also target multiple devices. For instance, this`@media`rule uses two media queries to target both screen and print devices:


```
@media screen, print { ... }
```


See[Media types](%30559#Media_types "")for a list of all media types. Because they describe devices in only very broad terms, just a few are available; to target more specific attributes, use*media features*instead.


## Targeting media features<a name="Targeting_media_features"></a>


Media features describe the specific characteristics of a given[user agent]3517 "user agent: A user agent is a computer program representing a person, for example, a browser in a Web context."), output device, or environment. For instance, you can apply specific styles to widescreen monitors, computers that use mice, or to devices that are being used in low-light conditions. This example applies styles when the user&#39;s*primary*input mechanism (such as a mouse) can hover over elements:


```
@media (hover: hover) { ... }
```


Many media features are*range features*, which means they can be prefixed with &quot;min-&quot; or &quot;max-&quot; to express &quot;minimum condition&quot; or &quot;maximum condition&quot; constraints. For example, this CSS will apply styles only if your browser&#39;s[viewport]14371 "viewport: A viewport represents a polygonal (normally rectangular) area in computer graphics that is currently being viewed. In web browser terms, it refers to the part of the document you're viewing which is currently visible in its window (or the screen, if the document is being viewed in full screen mode). Content outside the viewport is not visible onscreen until scrolled into view.")width is equal to or narrower than 12450px:


```
@media (max-width: 12450px) { ... }
```


If you create a media feature query without specifying a value, the nested styles will be used as long as the feature&#39;s value is non-zero. For example, this CSS will apply to any device with a color screen:


```
@media (color) { ... }
```


If a feature doesn&#39;t apply to the device on which the browser is running, expressions involving that media feature are always false. For example, the styles nested inside the following query will never be used, because no speech-only device has a screen aspect ratio:


```
@media speech and (aspect-ratio: 11/5) { ... }
```


For more[media feature](%30559#Media_features "")examples, please see the reference page for each specific feature.


## Creating complex media queries<a name="Creating_complex_media_queries"></a>


Sometimes you may want to create a media query that depends on multiple conditions. This is where the*logical operators*come in:`not`,`and`, and`only`. Furthermore, you can combine multiple media queries into a*comma-separated list*; this allows you to apply the same styles in different situations.



In the previous example, we&#39;ve already seen the`and`operator used to group a media*type*with a media*feature*. The`and`operator can also combine multiple media features into a single media query. The`not`operator, meanwhile, negates a media query, basically reversing its normal meaning. The`only`operator prevents older browsers from applying the styles.



**Note:**In most cases, the`all`media type is used by default when no other type is specified. However, if you use the`not`or`only`operators, you must explicitly specify a media type.



### Combining multiple types or features<a name="Combining_multiple_types_or_features"></a>


The`and`keyword combines a media feature with a media type*or*other media features. This example combines two media features to restrict styles to landscape-oriented devices with a width of at least 30 ems:


```
@media (min-width: 30em) and (orientation: landscape) { ... }
```


To limit the styles to devices with a screen, you can chain the media features to the`screen`media type:


```
@media screen and (min-width: 30em) and (orientation: landscape) { ... }
```

### Testing for multiple queries<a name="Testing_for_multiple_queries"></a>


You can use a comma-separated list to apply styles when the user&#39;s device matches any one of various media types, features, or states. For instance, the following rule will apply its styles if the user&#39;s device has either a minimum height of 680px*or*is a screen device in portrait mode:


```
@media (min-height: 680px), screen and (orientation: portrait) { ... }
```


Taking the above example, if the user had a printer with a page height of 800px, the media statement would return true because the first query would apply. Likewise, if the user were on a smartphone in portrait mode with a viewport height of 480px, the second query would apply and the media statement would still return true.


### Inverting a query&#39;s meaning<a name="Inverting_a_query's_meaning"></a>


The`not`keyword inverts the meaning of an entire media query. It will only negate the specific media query it is applied to. (Thus, it will not apply to every media query in a comma-separated list of media queries.) The`not`keyword can&#39;t be used to negate an individual feature query, only an entire media query. The`not`is evaluated last in the following query:


```
@media not all and (monochrome) { ... }
```


... so that the above query is evaluated like this:


```
@media not (all and (monochrome)) { ... }
```


... rather than like this:


```
@media (not all) and (monochrome) { ... }
```


As another example, the following media query:


```
@media not screen and (color), print and (color) { ... }
```


... is evaluated like this:


```
@media (not (screen and (color))), print and (color) { ... }
```

### Improving compatibility with older browsers<a name="Improving_compatibility_with_older_browsers"></a>


The`only`keyword prevents older browsers that do not support media queries with media features from applying the given styles.*It has no effect on modern browsers.*


```
@media (only screen and (color)) { ... }
```
