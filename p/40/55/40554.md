SIMD.js has been[taken out of active development in TC39]41628 "")and removed from Stage 3. It is not being pursued by web browsers for implementation anymore. SIMD operations exposed to the web are under active development within[WebAssembly]21620 ""), with operations based on the SIMD.js operations.



The**`SIMD.Int8x16`**data type is a 128-bit vector divided into 16 lanes storing 8-bit signed integer values.

## Syntax<a name="Syntax"></a>

```
SIMD.Int8x16(s0,s1,s2,s3,s4,s5,s6,s7,s8,s9,s10,s11,s12,s13,s14,s15);
```

### Parameters<a name="Parameters"></a>
<dl><dt id=''>`s[0-15]`Optional</dt><dd>An integer specifying the value of the lane. Defaults to 0.</dd></dl>
## Constructor functions<a name="Constructor_functions"></a>


In addition to the simple creator functions, the SIMD API provides the following constructor functions:

<dl><dt id=''>[`SIMD.Int8x16.splat()`]42564 "SIMD.js has been taken out of active development in TC39 and removed from Stage 3. It is not being pursued by web browsers for implementation anymore. SIMD operations exposed to the web are under active development within WebAssembly, with operations based on the SIMD.js operations.")</dt><dd>Creates an Int8x16 with all lanes set to a given value.</dd></dl>

Note that you can also[convert from another SIMD data type to Int8x16](%40554#Data_conversions "").



**Note:**SIMD types don&#39;t work with`new`, as SIMD values are no &quot;boxed&quot; objects (comparable to`String(s)`vs.`new String(s)`, which creates a String object).


```
var v = new SIMD.Int8x16(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16); 
// TypeError: SIMD.Int8x16 is not a constructor
var w = new SIMD.Int8x16.splat(3); 
// TypeError: SIMD.Int8x16.splat is not a constructor
```


Instead, you just write:


```
var v = SIMD.Int8x16(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16);
var w = SIMD.Int8x16.splat(3);
```
