The**`<integer>`**[CSS]427 "")[data type]27786 "")is a special type of[`<number>`]4564 "The <number> CSS data type represents a number, being either an integer or a number with a fractional component.")that represents a whole number, whether positive or negative. Integers can be used in numerous CSS properties, such as[`column-count`]33506 "The column-count CSS property breaks an element's content into the specified number of columns."),[`counter-increment`]29552 "The counter-increment CSS property increases or decreases the value of a CSS counter by a given value."),[`grid-column`]30378 "The grid-column CSS property is a shorthand property for grid-column-start and grid-column-end specifying a grid item's size and location within the grid row by contributing a line, a span, or nothing (automatic) to its grid placement, thereby specifying the inline-start and inline-end edge of its grid area."),[`grid-row`]30383 "The grid-row CSS property is a shorthand property for grid-row-start and grid-row-end specifying a grid item’s size and location within the grid row by contributing a line, a span, or nothing (automatic) to its grid placement, thereby specifying the inline-start and inline-end edge of its grid area."), and[`z-index`]33507 "The z-index CSS property specifies the z-order of a positioned element and its descendants. When elements overlap, z-order determines which one covers the other. An element with a larger z-index generally covers an element with a lower one.").


## Syntax<a name="Syntax"></a>


The`<integer>`data type consists of one or several decimal digits, 0 through 9 inclusive, optionally preceded by a single`+`or`-`sign. There is no unit associated with integers.

**Note:**There is no official range of valid`<integer>`values. Opera 12.1 supports values up to 2<sup>15</sup>-1, IE up to 2<sup>20</sup>-1, and other browsers even higher. During the CSS3 Values cycle there was a lot of discussion about setting a minimum range to support: the latest decision,[in April 2012 during the LC phase]30617 ""), was [-2<sup>27</sup>-1; 2<sup>27</sup>-1], but other values like 2<sup>24</sup>-1 and 2<sup>30</sup>-1[were also proposed]30618 ""). However, the latest spec doesn&#39;t specify a range anymore.

## Interpolation<a name="Interpolation"></a>


When animated, values of the`<integer>`data type are interpolated using discrete, whole steps. The calculation is done as if they were real, floating-point numbers; the discrete value is obtained using the[floor function]30619 "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floor_function"). The speed of the interpolation is determined by the[timing function]28336 "timing-function")associated with the animation.

### Invalid integers<a name="Invalid_integers"></a>

```
12.0        This is a <number>, not an <integer>, though it represents an integer.
12.         Decimal points are not allowed.
+---12      Only one leading +/- is allowed.
ten         Letters are not allowed.
_5          Special characters are not allowed.
