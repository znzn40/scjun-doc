The**`:focus`**[CSS](%427 "")[pseudo-class](%29702 "Pseudo-classes")represents an element (such as a form input) that has received focus. It is generally triggered when the user clicks or taps on an element or selects it with the keyboard&#39;s &quot;tab&quot; key.


```
/* Selects any <input> when focused */
input:focus {
  color: red;
}
```


**Note:**This pseudo-class applies only to the focused element itself. Use[`:focus-within`](%32741 "The :focus-within CSS pseudo-class represents an element that has received focus or contains an element that has received focus. In other words, it represents an element that is itself matched by the :focus pseudo-class or has a descendant that is matched by :focus. (This includes descendants in shadow trees.)")if you want to select an element that*contains*a focused element.
