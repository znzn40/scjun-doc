### Return value<a name="Return_value"></a>


[`undefined`]14139 "The global undefined property represents the primitive value undefined. It is one of JavaScript's primitive types.").


### Errors<a name="Errors"></a>


If an error occurs and an`errorCallback`was specified, it gets called with a single parameter: a[`FileError`]11192 "Represents an error that occurs while using the FileReader interface.")object describing the error. The {domxref(&quot;FileError.code&quot;)}} specifies what type of error occurred, as follows:

<dl><dt id=''>`FileError.NOT_FOUND_ERR`</dt><dd>The`create`option was not specified (or was specified as`false`), and the file doesn&#39;t exist.</dd><dt id=''>`FileError.PATH_EXISTS_ERR`</dt><dd>The`create`and`exclusive`options were both`true`, indicating that the file should be created but must not already exist, but the file does in fact already exist.</dd><dt id=''>`FileError.SECURITY_ERR`</dt><dd>The request to access the file was denied for security reasons.</dd><dt id=''>`FileError.TYPE_MISMATCH_ERR`</dt><dd>The path specified is not a file; it&#39;s probably a directory, but might be an unsupported file descriptor such as a pipe; this depends on the user agent to some extent.</dd></dl>
## FileSystemFlags<a name="FileSystemFlags"></a>


The`options`parameter is an object which is based on the[`FileSystemFlags`]11258 "The FileSystemFlags dictionary defines a set of values which are used when specifying option flags when calling certain methods in the File and Directory Entries API. Methods which accept an options parameter of this type may specify zero or more of these flags as fields in an object, like this:")dictionary; it provides flags which make it possible to adjust the behavior of the`getFile()`method.

<dl><dt id=''>[`create`]11262 "The create property on the FileSystemFlags dictionary is used to indicate whether or not the file should be created if it's missing. FileSystemFlags is only used when calling FileSystemDirectoryEntry.getFile() or FileSystemDirectoryEntry.getDirectory().")Optional</dt><dd>If this property is`true`, and the requested file or directory doesn&#39;t exist, the user agent should create it. The default is`false`. The parent directory must already exist.</dd><dt id=''>[`exclusive`]11264 "The exclusive property on the FileSystemFlags dictionary is used in tandem with the create property to determine whether or not it's acceptable to require that the file not already exist when the reference to it is created by calling FileSystemDirectoryEntry.getFile() or FileSystemDirectoryEntry.getDirectory().")Optional</dt><dd>If`true`, and the`create`option is also`true`, the file must not exist prior to issuing the call. Instead, it must be possible for it to be created newly at call time. The default is`false`.</dd></dl>
### Values and results<a name="Values_and_results"></a>


The table below describes the result of each possible combination of these flags depending on whether or not the target file or directory path already exists.


Option values | File/directory condition | Result 
[`create`]11262 "The create property on the FileSystemFlags dictionary is used to indicate whether or not the file should be created if it's missing. FileSystemFlags is only used when calling FileSystemDirectoryEntry.getFile() or FileSystemDirectoryEntry.getDirectory().") | [`exclusive`]11264 "The exclusive property on the FileSystemFlags dictionary is used in tandem with the create property to determine whether or not it's acceptable to require that the file not already exist when the reference to it is created by calling FileSystemDirectoryEntry.getFile() or FileSystemDirectoryEntry.getDirectory().")

## Example<a name="Example"></a>


In this example, a function is presented whose job it is to locate within a user&#39;s app data directory a JSON file containing a user dictionary for a specified language, then load that dictionary.


```
let dictionary = null;

function loadDictionaryForLanguage(appDataDirEntry, lang) {
  dictionary = null;

  appDataDirEntry.getDirectory("Dictionaries", {}, function(dirEntry) {
    dirEntry.getFile(lang + "-dict.json", {}, function(fileEntry) {
      fileEntry.file(function(dictFile)) {
        let reader = new FileReader();

        reader.addEventListener("loadend", function() {
          dictionary = JSON.parse(reader.result);
        });

        reader.readAsText(dictFile);
      });
    });
  });
}
```


The`loadDictionaryForLanguage()`function starts by using`getDirectory()`to obtain the[`FileSystemDirectoryEntry`]11161 "The FileSystemDirectoryEntry interface of the File and Directory Entries API represents a directory in a file system. It provides methods which make it possible to access and manipulate the files in a directory, as well as to access the entries within the directory.")object representing a subfolder named &quot;Dictionaries&quot; located inside the specified app data directory. The success callback for this takes the resulting directory entry object and calls[`getFile()`]26914 "The FileSystemDirectoryEntry interface's method getFile() returns a FileSystemFileEntry object corresponding to a file contained somewhere within the directory subtree rooted at the directory on which it's called.")to get a[`FileSystemFileEntry`]11160 "The FileSystemFileEntry interface of the File System API represents a file in a file system. It offers properties describing the file's attributes, as well as the file() method, which creates a File object that can be used to read the file.")object representing the dictionary file; the success callback for this, in turn, creates a new[`FileReader`]26894 "The FileReader object lets web applications asynchronously read the contents of files (or raw data buffers) stored on the user's computer, using File or Blob objects to specify the file or data to read.")and uses it to load the contents of the file. When that is loaded successfully (as indicated by the`[loadend]8814 "/en-US/docs/Web/Events/loadend")`event being fired), the loaded text is passed into[`JSON.parse()`]26915 "The JSON.parse() method parses a JSON string, constructing the JavaScript value or object described by the string. An optional reviver function can be provided to perform a transformation on the resulting object before it is returned.")to be reconstituted into a JavaScript object.
