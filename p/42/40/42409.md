SIMD.js has been[taken out of active development in TC39]41628 "")and removed from Stage 3. It is not being pursued by web browsers for implementation anymore. SIMD operations exposed to the web are under active development within[WebAssembly]21620 ""), with operations based on the SIMD.js operations.



The static**`SIMD.%type%.addSaturate()`**method returns a new instance with the lane values added (`a + b`) and saturating behavior on overflow.



Note: This operation is not defined on[`Uint32x4`]40857 "SIMD.js has been taken out of active development in TC39 and removed from Stage 3.

## Syntax<a name="Syntax"></a>

```
SIMD.Int8x16.addSaturate(a, b)
SIMD.Int16x8.addSaturate(a, b)

SIMD.Uint8x16.addSaturate(a, b) 
SIMD.Uint16x8.addSaturate(a, b)

```

### Parameters<a name="Parameters"></a>
<dl><dt id=''>a</dt><dd>An instance of a SIMD type.</dd><dt id=''>`b`</dt><dd>Another instance of a SIMD type.</dd></dl>
### Return value<a name="Return_value"></a>


A new corresponding SIMD data type with the lane values of`a`and`b`added (`a + b`).


## Examples<a name="Examples"></a>


The following example demonstrates the saturating behavior for Uint16 (maximum value 65535) and Int16 (maximum value 32767). If the addition overflows, the lanes will have the maximum possible value.


```
var a = SIMD.Uint16x8(65533, 65534, 65535, 65535, 1, 1, 1, 1); 
var b = SIMD.Uint16x8(1, 1, 1, 5000, 1, 1, 1, 1); 
SIMD.Uint16x8.addSaturate(a, b); 
// Uint16x8[65534, 65535, 65535, 65535, 2, 2, 2, 2]

var c = SIMD.Int16x8(32765, 32766, 32767, 32767, 1, 1, 1, 1);
var d = SIMD.Int16x8(1, 1, 1, 5000, 1, 1, 1, 1);
SIMD.Int16x8.addSaturate(c, d);
// Int16x8[32766, 32767, 32767, 32767, 2, 2, 2, 2]
```

## Browser compatibility<a name="Browser_compatibility"></a>


Experimental SIMD.js has been removed from browsers. It&#39;s still available in Firefox Nightly, but will be removed in favor of a SIMD implementation in[WebAssembly]21620 ""). See also[bug 1416723]42510 "Consider removing SIMD.js?").
