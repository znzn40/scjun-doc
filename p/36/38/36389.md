The**`fill`**attribute has two different meaning: For shapes and text it&#39;s a presentation attribute that lets define the color (*or any SVG paint servers like gradients or patterns*) used to paint the element; for animation it lets define what is the final state of the animation.



As a presentation attribute, it can be applied to any element but it has effect only on the following eleven elements:[`<altGlyph>`]38642 "The <altGlyph> SVG element allows sophisticated selection of the glyphs used to render its child character data."),[`<circle>`]18195 "The <circle> SVG element is an SVG basic shape, used to create circles based on a center point and a radius."),[`<ellipse>`]17568 "The <ellipse> element is an SVG basic shape, used to create ellipses based on a center coordinate, and both their x and y radius."),[`<path>`]38643 "The <path> SVG element is the generic element to define a shape. All the basic shapes can be created with a path element."),[`<polygon>`]18098 "The <polygon> element defines a closed shape consisting of a set of connected straight line segments. The last point is connected to the first point. For open shapes see the <polyline> element."),[`<polyline>`]18103 "The <polyline> SVG element is an SVG basic shape that creates straight lines connecting several points. Typically a polyline is used to create open shapes as the last point doesn't have to be connected to the first point. For closed shapes see the <polygon> element."),[`<rect>`]18128 "The <rect> element is a basic SVG shape that creates rectangles, defined by their corner's position, their width, and their height. The rectangles may have their corners rounded."),[`<text>`]18290 "The SVG <text> element defines a graphics element consisting of text. It's possible to apply a gradient, pattern, clipping path, mask, or filter to <text>, just like any other SVG graphics element."),[`<textPath>`]18295 "In addition to text drawn in a straight line, SVG also includes the ability to place text along the shape of a <path> element. To specify that a block of text is to be rendered along the shape of a <path>, include the given text within a <textPath> element which includes an href attribute with a reference to a <path> element."),[`<tref>`]18249 "The textual content for a <text> SVG element can be either character data directly embedded within the <text> element or the character data content of a referenced element, where the referencing is specified with a <tref> element."), and[`<tspan>`]18255 "Within a <text> element, text and font properties and the current text position can be adjusted with absolute or relative coordinate values by including a <tspan> element.")



For animation five elements are using this attribute:[`<animate>`]17380 "This element implements the SVGAnimateElement interface."),[`<animateColor>`]17375 "The <animateColor> SVG element specifies a color transformation over time."),[`<animateMotion>`]17386 "The <animateMotion> element causes a referenced element to move along a motion path."),[`<animateTransform>`]17391 "The animateTransform element animates a transformation attribute on a target element, thereby allowing animations to control translation, scaling, rotation and/or skewing."), and[`<set>`]18204 "The <set> element provides a simple means of just setting the value of an attribute for a specified duration. It supports all attribute types, including those that cannot reasonably be interpolated, such as string and boolean values. The <set> element is non-additive. The additive and accumulate attributes are not allowed, and will be ignored if specified.")
