[1] To determine if a sender has at least one active encoding, the[user agent](%3517 "user agent: A user agent is a computer program representing a person, for example, a browser in a Web context.")gets its parameters using[`RTCRtpSender.getParameters()`](%17042 "The documentation about this has not yet been written; please consider contributing!"), then looks at the parameters&#39;[`encodings`](%17088 "The documentation about this has not yet been written; please consider contributing!")property; if any of the listed encodings has its[`active`](%17000 "The documentation about this has not yet been written; please consider contributing!")property set to`true`, the sender has an active encoding.
