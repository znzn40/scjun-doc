The`connect()`method of the[`AudioNode`](%3857 "The AudioNode interface is a generic interface for representing an audio processing module. Examples include:")interface lets you connect one of the node&#39;s outputs to a target, which may be either another`AudioNode`(thereby directing the sound data to the specified node) or an[`AudioParam`](%3874 "There are two kinds of AudioParam, a-rate and k-rate parameters:"), so that the node&#39;s output data is automatically used to change the value of that parameter over time.



## Syntax<a name="Syntax"></a>

```
var destinationNode = AudioNode.connect(destination, outputIndex, inputIndex);

AudioNode.connect(destination, outputIndex);

```

### Parameters<a name="Parameters"></a>
<dl><dt id=''>`destination`</dt><dd>The[`AudioNode`](%3857 "The AudioNode interface is a generic interface for representing an audio processing module. Examples include:")or[`AudioParam`](%3874 "There are two kinds of AudioParam, a-rate and k-rate parameters:")to which to connect.</dd><dt id=''>`outputIndex`Optional</dt><dd>An index specifying which output of the current`AudioNode`to connect to the destination. The index numbers are defined according to the number of output channels (see[Audio channels](%23021 "")). While you can only connect a given output to a given input once (repeated attempts are ignored), you can connect an output to multiple inputs by calling`connect()`repeatedly. This makes[fan-out](%23022 "")possible. The default value is 0.</dd><dt id=''>`inputIndex`Optional</dt><dd>An index describing which input of the destination you want to connect the current`AudioNode`to; the default is 0. The index numbers are defined according to the number of input channels (see[Audio channels](%23021 "")). It is possible to connect an`AudioNode`to another`AudioNode`, which in turn connects back to the first`AudioNode`, creating a cycle. This is allowed only if there is at least one[`DelayNode`](%6959 "The DelayNode interface represents a delay-line; an AudioNode audio-processing module that causes a delay between the arrival of an input data and its propagation to the output. A DelayNode always has exactly one input and one output, both with the same amount of channels.")in the cycle. Otherwise, a`NotSupportedError`exception is thrown. This parameter is not allowed if the destination is an[`AudioParam`](%3874 "There are two kinds of AudioParam, a-rate and k-rate parameters:").</dd></dl>
### Return value<a name="Return_value"></a>


If the destination is a node,`connect()`returns a reference to the destination[`AudioNode`](%3857 "The AudioNode interface is a generic interface for representing an audio processing module. Examples include:")object, allowing you to chain multiple`connect()`calls. In some browsers, older implementations of this interface return[`undefined`](%14139 "The global undefined property represents the primitive value undefined. It is one of JavaScript's primitive types.").



If the destination is an`AudioParam`,`connect()`returns`undefined`.


### Exceptions<a name="Exceptions"></a>

A DelayNode always has exactly one input and one output, both with the same amount of channels.")s in the cycle to prevent the resulting waveform from getting stuck constructing the same audio frame indefinitely.</dd></dl>
## Examples<a name="Examples"></a>

### Connecting to an audio input<a name="Connecting_to_an_audio_input"></a>


The most obvious use of the`connect()`method is to direct the audio output from one node into the audio input of another node for further processing. For example, you might send the audio from a[`MediaElementAudioSourceNode`](%14121 "A MediaElementSourceNode has no inputs and exactly one output, and is created using the AudioContext.createMediaElementSource method. The amount of channels in the output equals the number of channels of the audio referenced by the HTMLMediaElement used in the creation of the node, or is 1 if the HTMLMediaElement has no audio.")—that is, the audio from an HTML5 media element such as[`<audio>`](%13227 "The HTML <audio> element is used to embed sound content in documents. It may contain one or more audio sources, represented using the src attribute or the <source> element: the browser will choose the most suitable one. It can also be the destination for streamed media, using a MediaStream.")—through a band pass filter implemented using a[`BiquadFilterNode`](%13984 "The BiquadFilterNode interface represents a simple low-order filter, and is created using the AudioContext.createBiquadFilter() method. It is an AudioNode that can represent different kinds of filters, tone control devices, and graphic equalizers.")to reduce noise before then sending the audio along to the speakers.



This example creates an oscillator, then links it to a gain node, so that the gain node controls the volume of the oscillator node.


```
var AudioContext = window.AudioContext || window.webkitAudioContext;

var audioCtx = new AudioContext();

var oscillator = audioCtx.createOscillator();
var gainNode = audioCtx.createGain();

oscillator.connect(gainNode);
gainNode.connect(audioCtx.destination);
```

### AudioParam example<a name="AudioParam_example"></a>


In this example, we will be altering the gain value of a[`GainNode`](%5035 "The GainNode interface represents a change in volume. It is an AudioNode audio-processing module that causes a given gain to be applied to the input data before its propagation to the output. A GainNode always has exactly one input and one output, both with the same number of channels.")using an[`OscillatorNode`](%3965 "The OscillatorNode interface represents a periodic waveform, such as a sine wave. It is an AudioScheduledSourceNode audio-processing module that causes a specified frequency of a given wave to be created—in effect, a constant tone.")with a slow frequency value. This technique is know as an<em>LFO</em>-controlled parameter.


```
var AudioContext = window.AudioContext || window.webkitAudioContext;

var audioCtx = new AudioContext();

// create an normal oscillator to make sound
var oscillator = audioCtx.createOscillator();

// create a second oscillator that will be used as an LFO (Low-frequency
// oscillator), and will control a parameter
var lfo = audioCtx.createOscillator();

// set the frequency of the second oscillator to a low number
lfo.frequency.value = 2.0; // 2Hz: two oscillations par second

// create a gain whose gain AudioParam will be controlled by the LFO
var gain = audioCtx.createGain();

// connect the LFO to the gain AudioParam. This means the value of the LFO
// will not produce any audio, but will change the value of the gain instead
lfo.connect(gain.gain);

// connect the oscillator that will produce audio to the gain
oscillator.connect(gain);

// connect the gain to the destination so we hear sound
gain.connect(audioCtx.destination);

// start the oscillator that will produce audio
oscillator.start();

// start the oscillator that will modify the gain value
lfo.start(); 
 

```

#### AudioParam notes<a name="AudioParam_notes"></a>


It is possible to connect an`AudioNode`output to more than one[`AudioParam`](%3874 "There are two kinds of AudioParam, a-rate and k-rate parameters:"), and more than one AudioNode output to a single[`AudioParam`](%3874 "There are two kinds of AudioParam, a-rate and k-rate parameters:"), with multiple calls to`connect()`.[Fan-in and fan-out](%23022 "")are therefore supported.



An[`AudioParam`](%3874 "There are two kinds of AudioParam, a-rate and k-rate parameters:")will take the rendered audio data from any`AudioNode`output connected to it and convert it to mono by[down-mixing](%3917 "")(if it is not already mono). Next, it will mix it together with any other such outputs, and the intrinsic parameter value (the value the[`AudioParam`](%3874 "There are two kinds of AudioParam, a-rate and k-rate parameters:")would normally have without any audio connections), including any timeline changes scheduled for the parameter.



Therefore, it is possible to choose the range in which an[`AudioParam`](%3874 "There are two kinds of AudioParam, a-rate and k-rate parameters:")will change by setting the value of the[`AudioParam`](%3874 "There are two kinds of AudioParam, a-rate and k-rate parameters:")to the central frequency, and to use a[`GainNode`](%5035 "The GainNode interface represents a change in volume. It is an AudioNode audio-processing module that causes a given gain to be applied to the input data before its propagation to the output. A GainNode always has exactly one input and one output, both with the same number of channels.")between the audio source and the[`AudioParam`](%3874 "There are two kinds of AudioParam, a-rate and k-rate parameters:")to adjust the range of the[`AudioParam`](%3874 "There are two kinds of AudioParam, a-rate and k-rate parameters:")changes.
