The**`radial-gradient()`**[CSS]427 "")function creates an image consisting of a progressive transition between two or more colors that radiate from an origin. Its shape may be a circle or an ellipse. The function&#39;s result is an object of the[`<gradient>`]28329 "The <gradient> CSS data type is a special type of <image> that consists of a progressive transition between two or more colors.")data type, which is a special kind of[`<image>`]28330 "The <image> CSS data type represents a two-dimensional image. There are two kinds of images: plain images, referenced with a <url>, and dynamically-generated images, generated with <gradient> or element(). Images can be used with numerous CSS properties, such as background-image, border-image, content, cursor, and list-style-image.").

As with any gradient, a radial gradient has[no intrinsic dimensions]30309 ""); i.e., it has no natural or preferred size, nor a preferred ratio. Its concrete size will match the size of the element it applies to.



To create a radial gradient that repeats so as to fill its container, use the[`repeating-radial-gradient()`]33480 "The repeating-radial-gradient() CSS function creates an image consisting of repeating gradients that radiate from an origin. It is similar to radial-gradient() and takes the same arguments, but it repeats the color stops infinitely in all directions so as to cover its entire container. The function's result is an object of the <gradient> data type, which is a special kind of <image>.")function instead.



Because`<gradient>`s belong to the`<image>`data type, they can only be used where`<image>`s can be used. For this reason,`radial-gradient()`won&#39;t work on[`background-color`]29451 "The background-color CSS property sets the background color of an element.")and other properties that use the[`<color>`]4569 "The <color> CSS data type represents a color in the sRGB color space. A <color> may also include an alpha-channel transparency value, indicating how the color should composite with its background.")data type.


## Composition of a radial gradient<a name="Composition_of_a_radial_gradient"></a>


![]31692 "")A radial gradient is defined by a*center point*, an*ending shape*, and two or more*color-stop points*.



To create a smooth gradient, the`radial-gradient()`function draws a series of concentric shapes radiating out from the center to the ending shape (and potentially beyond). The ending shape may be either a circle or an ellipse.



Color-stop points are positioned on a*virtual gradient ray*that extends horizontally from the center towards the right. Percentage-based color-stop positions are relative to the intersection between the ending shape and this gradient ray, which represents`100%`. Each shape is a single color determined by the color on the gradient ray it intersects.


## Syntax<a name="Syntax"></a>

```
/* A gradient at the center of its container,
   starting red, changing to blue, and finishing green */
radial-gradient(circle at center, red 0, blue, green 100%)

Keyword | Description 
`closest-side` | The gradient&#39;s ending shape meets the side of the box closest to its center (for circles) or meets both the vertical and horizontal sides closest to the center (for ellipses). 
`closest-corner` | The gradient&#39;s ending shape is sized so that it exactly meets the closest corner of the box from its center. 
`farthest-side` | Similar to`closest-side`, except the ending shape is sized to meet the side of the box farthest from its center (or vertical and horizontal sides). 
`farthest-corner` | The gradient&#39;s ending shape is sized so that it exactly meets the farthest corner of the box from its center. 



**Note:**Early implementations of this function included other keywords (`cover`and`contain`) as synonyms of the standard`farthest-corner`and`closest-side`, respectively. Use the standard keywords only, as some implementations have already dropped those older variants.

[1] Firefox 3.6 implemented, prefixed, an early syntax. Before Firefox 36, Gecko didn&#39;t apply gradient on the pre-multiplied color space, leading to shade of grey unexpectedly appearing when used with transparency. Since Firefox 42, the prefixed version of gradients can be disabled by setting`layout.css.prefixes.gradients`to`false`.



[2] Webkit implemented, prefixed, an early syntax. WebKit since 528 supports the legacy[`-webkit-gradient(radial,…)`function]31699 ""). See also their[current support]31700 "")for radial gradients.



[3] Internet Explorer 5.5 through 9.0 supports proprietary[`filter: progid:DXImageTransform.Microsoft.Gradient()`filter]30772 "").



[4] In addition to the unprefixed support, Gecko 44.0 (Firefox 44.0 / Thunderbird 44.0 / SeaMonkey 2.41) added support for a`-webkit`prefixed version of the function for web compatibility reasons behind the preference`layout.css.prefixes.webkit`, defaulting to`false`. Since Gecko 49.0 (Firefox 49.0 / Thunderbird 49.0 / SeaMonkey 2.46) the preference defaults to`true`.


### Quantum CSS notes<a name="Quantum_CSS_notes"></a>

* Gecko has a long-standing bug whereby radial gradient values like`radial-gradient(circle gold,red)`will work, even though they shouldn&#39;t because of the missing comma between`circle`and`gold`([bug 1383323]36740 "FIXED: radial-gradient(circle gold,red)  must not work (missing comma)")). Firefox&#39;s new parallel CSS engine (also known as[Quantum CSS]29311 "")or[Stylo]29312 ""), planned for release in Firefox 57) fixes this bug.
* Also in Gecko,[`calc()`]28742 "The calc() CSS function lets you perform calculations when specifying CSS property values. It can be used anywhere a <length>, <frequency>, <angle>, <time>, <percentage>, <number>, or <integer> is allowed.")expressions are rejected — causing the value to be invalid — when used as the radius component of a radial-gradient() function ([bug 1376019]29310 "FIXED: calc() expressions are rejected, in radial-gradient() radius components")). Firefox&#39;s new parallel CSS engine (also known as[Quantum CSS]29311 "")or[Stylo]29312 ""), planned for release in Firefox 57) fixes this.
