The`**performance**`read-only property of the[`WorkerGlobalScope`](%4856 "The WorkerGlobalScope interface of the Web Workers API is an interface representing the scope of any worker. Workers have no browsing context; this scope contains the information usually conveyed by Window objects — in this case event handlers, the console or the associated WorkerNavigator object. Each WorkerGlobalScope has its own event loop.")interface returns a[`Performance`](%24322 "The Performance interface provides access to performance-related information for the current page. It's part of the High Resolution Time API, but is enhanced by the Performance Timeline API, the Navigation Timing API, the User Timing API, and the Resource Timing API.")object to be used on the worker.



Not all[`Performance`](%24322 "The Performance interface provides access to performance-related information for the current page. It's part of the High Resolution Time API, but is enhanced by the Performance Timeline API, the Navigation Timing API, the User Timing API, and the Resource Timing API.")properties and methods are available to Web workers.




This property isRead only.


## Syntax<a name="Syntax"></a>

```
var perfObj = self.performance;

```

### Return Value<a name="Return_value"></a>


A[`Performance`](%24322 "The Performance interface provides access to performance-related information for the current page. It's part of the High Resolution Time API, but is enhanced by the Performance Timeline API, the Navigation Timing API, the User Timing API, and the Resource Timing API.")object.


## Example<a name="Example"></a>


If you called


```
console.log(performance);
```


inside a worker (which would basically be the equivalent of`self.console.log(self.performance);`, as these are being called on the worker scope, which can be referenced with[`WorkerGlobalScope.self`](%24306 "The self read-only property of the WorkerGlobalScope interface returns a reference to the WorkerGlobalScope itself. Most of the time it is a specific scope like DedicatedWorkerGlobalScope,  SharedWorkerGlobalScope, or ServiceWorkerGlobalScope.")), you will get a[`WorkerPerformance`](%24323 "The documentation about this has not yet been written; please consider contributing!")object written to the console — something like the following:


```
WorkerPerformance {now: function}
  __proto__: WorkerPerformance
    constructor: function WorkerPerformance() { [native code] }
    now: function now() { [native code] }
    __proto__: Object
```


You could use this performance object to return performance data, as you might do with a normal[`Performance`](%24322 "The Performance interface provides access to performance-related information for the current page. It's part of the High Resolution Time API, but is enhanced by the Performance Timeline API, the Navigation Timing API, the User Timing API, and the Resource Timing API.")object.



**Note**: Firefox has a bug with using`console.log`inside shared/service workers (see[bug 1058644](%24309 "FIXED: Console API doesn't work in SharedWorkers or ServiceWorkers")), which may return strange results, but this should be fixed soon.
