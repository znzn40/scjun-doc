The**`RTCDataChannelEvent()`**constructor returns a new[`RTCDataChannelEvent`](%16753 "The RTCDataChannelEvent() constructor returns a new RTCDataChannelEvent object, which represents a datachannel event. These events sent to an RTCPeerConnection when its remote peer is asking to open an RTCDataChannel between the two peers.")object, which represents a[`datachannel`](%16755 "The documentation about this has not yet been written; please consider contributing!")event. These events sent to an[`RTCPeerConnection`](%16675 "The RTCPeerConnection interface represents a WebRTC connection between the local computer and a remote peer. It provides methods to connect to a remote peer, maintain and monitor the connection, and close the connection once it's no longer needed.")when its remote peer is asking to open an[`RTCDataChannel`](%16756 "The RTCDataChannel interface represents a network channel which can be used for bidirectional peer-to-peer transfers of arbitrary data. Every data channel is associated with an RTCPeerConnection, and each peer connection can have up to a theoretical maximum of 65,534 data channels (the actual limit may vary from browser to browser).")between the two peers.



You will rarely if ever construct an`RTCDataChannelEvent`by hand; instead, the WebRTC layer will generate and deliver them to you at the appropriate time. Just listen for the`[datachannel](%16757 "/en-US/docs/Web/Events/datachannel")`event and when you receive it, use the[`RTCDataChannelEvent.channel`](%16758 "The read-only property RTCDataChannelEvent.channel returns the RTCDataChannel associated with the event.")property to gain access to the data channel which has been opened.

In this example, the`datachannel`event handler is set up to save the data channel reference and set up handlers for the events which need to be monitored. The[`channel`](%16758 "The read-only property RTCDataChannelEvent.channel returns the RTCDataChannel associated with the event.")property provides the[`RTCDataChannel`](%16756 "The RTCDataChannel interface represents a network channel which can be used for bidirectional peer-to-peer transfers of arbitrary data. Every data channel is associated with an RTCPeerConnection, and each peer connection can have up to a theoretical maximum of 65,534 data channels (the actual limit may vary from browser to browser).")representing the connection to the other peer.


```
pc.ondatachannel = function(event) {
  inboundDataChannel = event.channel;
  inboundDataChannel.onmessage = handleIncomingMessage;
  inboundDataChannel.onopen = handleChannelOpen;
  inboundDataChannel.onclose = handleChannelClose;
}
```
