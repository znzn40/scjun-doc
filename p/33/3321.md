**This is an[experimental technology](%3404 "")**<br></br>Check the[Browser compatibility table](%21719 "")carefully before using this in production.




The**`WritableStreamDefaultWriter`**interface of the the[Streams API](%4392 "")is the object returned by[`WritableStream.getWriter()`](%21657 "The getWriter() method of the WritableStream interface returns a new instance of WritableStreamDefaultWriter and locks the stream to that instance. While the stream is locked, no other writer can be acquired until this one is released.")and once created locks the &lt; writer to the`WritableStream`ensuring that no other streams can write to the underlying sink.

## Examples<a name="Examples"></a>


The following example shows the creation of a`WritableStream`with a custom sink and an API-supplied queueing strategy. It then calls a function called`sendMessage()`, passing the newly created stream and a string. Inside this function it calls the stream&#39;s`getWriter()`method, which returns an instance of[`WritableStreamDefaultWriter`](%21658 "The WritableStreamDefaultWriter interface of the the Streams API is the object returned by WritableStream.getWriter() and once created locks the < writer to the WritableStream ensuring that no other streams can write to the underlying sink."). A`forEach()`call is used to write each chunk of the string to the stream. Finally,`write()`and`close()`return promises that are processed to deal with success or failure of chunks and streams.



```
const list = document.querySelector('ul');

function sendMessage(message, writableStream) {
  // defaultWriter is of type WritableStreamDefaultWriter
  const defaultWriter = writableStream.getWriter();
  const encoder = new TextEncoder();
  const encoded = encoder.encode(message, { stream: true });
  encoded.forEach((chunk) => {
    defaultWriter.ready
      .then(() => {
        return defaultWriter.write(chunk);
      })
      .then(() => {
        console.log("Chunk written to sink.");
      })
      .catch((err) => {
        console.log("Chunk error:", err);
      });
  });
  // Call ready again to ensure that all chunks are written
  //   before closing the writer.
  defaultWriter.ready
    .then(() => {
      defaultWriter.close();
    })
    .then(() => {
      console.log("All chunks written");
    })
    .catch((err) => {
      console.log("Stream error:", err);
    });
}

const decoder = new TextDecoder("utf-8");
const queuingStrategy = new CountQueuingStrategy({ highWaterMark: 1 });
let result = "";
const writableStream = new WritableStream({
  // Implement the sink
  write(chunk) {
    return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
      var buffer = new ArrayBuffer(2);
      var view = new Uint16Array(buffer);
      view[0] = chunk;
      var decoded = decoder.decode(view, { stream: true });
      var listItem = document.createElement('li');
      listItem.textContent = "Chunk decoded: " + decoded;
      list.appendChild(listItem);
      result += decoded;
      resolve();
    });
  },
  close() {
    var listItem = document.createElement('li');
    listItem.textContent = "[MESSAGE RECEIVED] " + result;
    list.appendChild(listItem);
  },
  abort(err) {
    console.log("Sink error:", err);
  }
}, queuingStrategy);

sendMessage("Hello, world.", writableStream);
```
