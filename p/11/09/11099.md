**Non-standard**<br></br>This feature is non-standard and is not on a standards track. Do not use it on production sites facing the Web: it will not work for every user. There may also be large incompatibilities between implementations and the behavior may change in the future.



## Summary<a name="Summary"></a>


The`IDBMutableFile`interface provides access in read or write mode to a file, dealing with all the necessary locks.



**Note**: This interface used to be called`FileHandle`, but it was changed to this ([bug 1006485]13856 "FIXED: FileHandle: Rename FileHandle to MutableFile and LockedFile to FileHandle").)




As`IDBMutableFile`objects are bound to a fake file system built on top of IndexedDB, such an object is created using the[`IDBDatabase.createMutableFile`]13857 "The documentation about this has not yet been written; please consider contributing!")method.
