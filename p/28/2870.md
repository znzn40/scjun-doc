**Non-standard**<br></br>This feature is non-standard and is not on a standards track. Do not use it on production sites facing the Web: it will not work for every user. There may also be large incompatibilities between implementations and the behavior may change in the future.




The`**MSGestureEvent**`is a proprietary interface specific to Internet Explorer and Microsoft Edge which represents events that occur due to touch gestures. Events using this interface include`[MSGestureStart](%14608 "/en-US/docs/Web/Events/MSGestureStart")`,`[MSGestureEnd](%14609 "/en-US/docs/Web/Events/MSGestureEnd")`,`[MSGestureTap](%14610 "/en-US/docs/Web/Events/MSGestureTap")`,`[MSGestureHold](%14611 "/en-US/docs/Web/Events/MSGestureHold")`,`[MSGestureChange](%14612 "/en-US/docs/Web/Events/MSGestureChange")`, and`[MSInertiaStart](%14613 "/en-US/docs/Web/Events/MSInertiaStart")`.



`MSGestureEvent`derives from[`UIEvent`](%4948 "The UIEvent interface represents simple user interface events."), which in turn derives from[`Event`](%3943 "The Event interface represents any event which takes place in the DOM; some are user-generated (such as mouse or keyboard events), while others are generated by APIs (such as events that indicate an animation has finished running, a video has been paused, and so forth). There are many types of events, some of which use other interfaces based on the main Event interface. Event itself contains the properties and methods which are common to all events."). Though the[`MSGestureEvent.initGestureEvent()`](%14614 "The documentation about this has not yet been written; please consider contributing!")method is kept for backward compatibility, the creation of an`MSGestureEvent`object should be done using the[`MSGestureEvent()`](%14615 "The documentation about this has not yet been written; please consider contributing!")constructor.
