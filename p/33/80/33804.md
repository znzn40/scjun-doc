You can apply**multiple backgrounds**to elements. These are layered atop one another with the first background you provide on top and the last background listed in the back.Only the last background can include a background color.



Specifying multiple backgrounds is easy:


```
.myclass {
  background: background1, background 2, ..., backgroundN;
}
```


You can do this with both the shorthand[`background`](%28694 "The background CSS property lets you adjust all background style options at once, including color, image, origin and size, repeat method, and other features.")property and the individual properties thereof except for[`background-color`](%29451 "The background-color CSS property sets the background color of an element."). That is, the following background properties can be specified as a list, one per background:[`background`](%28694 "The background CSS property lets you adjust all background style options at once, including color, image, origin and size, repeat method, and other features."),[`background-attachment`](%33763 "If a background-image is specified, the background-attachment CSS property determines whether that image's position is fixed within the viewport, or scrolls along with its containing block."),[`background-clip`](%32976 "The background-clip CSS property specifies if an element's background, whether a <color> or an <image>, extends underneath its border."),[`background-image`](%29452 "The background-image CSS property sets one or more background images on an element."),[`background-origin`](%32977 "The background-origin CSS property sets the background positioning area, i.e., the origin position of an image specified using the background-image property."),[`background-position`](%30971 "The background-position CSS property sets the initial position, relative to the background position layer defined by background-origin, for each defined background image."),[`background-repeat`](%29243 "The background-repeat CSS property defines how background images are repeated. A background image can be repeated along the horizontal axis, the vertical axis, both axes, or not repeated at all."),[`background-size`](%32979 "The background-size CSS property specifies the size of an element's background image. The image can be left to its natural size, stretched to a new size, or constrained to fit the available space while preserving its intrinsic proportions.").


## Example<a name="Example"></a>


In this example, three backgrounds are stacked: the Firefox logo, an image of bubbles, and a[linear gradient](%33477 ""):


### HTML<a name="HTML"></a>

```
<div class="multi-bg-example"></div>
```

### CSS<a name="CSS"></a>

```
.multi-bg-example {
  width: 100%;
  height: 400px;
  background-image: url(https://mdn.mozillademos.org/files/11305/firefox.png),
      url(https://mdn.mozillademos.org/files/11307/bubbles.png),
      linear-gradient(to right, rgba(30, 75, 115, 1), rgba(255, 255, 255, 0));
  background-repeat: no-repeat,
      no-repeat,
      no-repeat;
  background-position: bottom right,
      left,
      right;
}
```

As you can see here, the Firefox logo (listed first within[`background-image`](%29452 "The background-image CSS property sets one or more background images on an element.")) is on top, directly above the bubbles graphic, followed by the gradient (listed last) sitting underneath all previous &#39;images&#39;. Each subsequent sub-property ([`background-repeat`](%29243 "The background-repeat CSS property defines how background images are repeated. A background image can be repeated along the horizontal axis, the vertical axis, both axes, or not repeated at all.")and[`background-position`](%30971 "The background-position CSS property sets the initial position, relative to the background position layer defined by background-origin, for each defined background image.")) applies to the corresponding backgrounds. So the first listed value for[`background-repeat`](%29243 "The background-repeat CSS property defines how background images are repeated. A background image can be repeated along the horizontal axis, the vertical axis, both axes, or not repeated at all.")applies to the first (frontmost) background, and so forth.
