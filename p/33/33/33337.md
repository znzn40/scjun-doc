**Non-standard**<br></br>This feature is non-standard and is not on a standards track. Do not use it on production sites facing the Web: it will not work for every user. There may also be large incompatibilities between implementations and the behavior may change in the future.

Not part of any specification.


## Remarks<a name="Remarks"></a>


In vertical layout, text lines are rotated 90Â° clockwise. Images are not rotated, but tables are. Box layout in vertical orientations is exactly analogous to layout in the horizontal orientation: width, height, top, bottom, right, and left do not rotate with the text.



Only one block progression is active at a time; these values cannot be combined.



This property is based on the`block-progression`property of the CSS3 Text Layout module.
