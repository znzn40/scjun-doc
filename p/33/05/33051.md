**Non-standard**<br></br>This feature is non-standard and is not on a standards track. Do not use it on production sites facing the Web: it will not work for every user. There may also be large incompatibilities between implementations and the behavior may change in the future.





The**`:-moz-last-node`**[CSS](%427 "")[pseudo-class](%29702 "Pseudo-classes")is a[Mozilla extension](%28318 "")that represents any element that is the last child node of some other element. It differs from[`:last-child`](%34514 "The :last-child CSS pseudo-class represents the last element among a group of sibling elements.")because it does not match a last-child element with (non-whitespace) text after it.



**Note:**Any whitespace at the end of an element is ignored for the determination of`:-moz-last-node`.
