SIMD.js has been[taken out of active development in TC39]41628 "")and removed from Stage 3. It is not being pursued by web browsers for implementation anymore. SIMD operations exposed to the web are under active development within[WebAssembly]21620 ""), with operations based on the SIMD.js operations.



The static**`SIMD.%type%.select()`**method creates a new integer SIMD data type with the lane values being a selection match from a selector mask.


## Syntax<a name="Syntax"></a>

```
SIMD.Float32x4.select(mask, trueValue, falseValue)
SIMD.Float64x2.select(mask, trueValue, falseValue)

SIMD.Int8x16.select(mask, trueValue, falseValue)
SIMD.Int16x8.select(mask, trueValue, falseValue)
SIMD.Int32x4.select(mask, trueValue, falseValue)

SIMD.Uint8x16.select(mask, trueValue, falseValue)
SIMD.Uint16x8.select(mask, trueValue, falseValue)
SIMD.Uint32x4.select(mask, trueValue, falseValue)

```

### Return value<a name="Return_value"></a>


A new SIMD data type.


## Description<a name="Description"></a>


The`SIMD.%type%.select()`method selects lanes from a selection mask. Masking (or &quot;branching&quot;) lanes is useful as you can&#39;t operate on a fraction of data in SIMD data types. However, with masks and the`select`function, you can branch and merge vectors to assemble the result vector you need.

## Examples<a name="Examples"></a>

### Custom selection mask<a name="Custom_selection_mask"></a>


This example uses the`SIMD.Bool32x4`type to create a custom selection mask. With this mask, you are able to select the first and the last lane from the first`Float32x4`data type. Thus, the`select`function selects the first and last lane from vector`a`and the second and third lane from vector`b`(or the`sum`vector in the second`select`).


```
var a = SIMD.Float32x4(1, 2, 3, 4);
var b = SIMD.Float32x4(5, 6, 7, 8);

var mask = SIMD.Bool32x4(true, false, false, true);

SIMD.Float32x4.select(mask, a, b);
// Float32x4[1, 6, 7, 4]

var sum = SIMD.Float32x4.add(a, b);
SIMD.Float32x4.select(mask, a, sum);
// Float32x4[1, 8, 10, 4]
```

### Operations returning a selection mask<a name="Operations_returning_a_selection_mask"></a>


All SIMD[comparison operations]41631 "")return a selection mask from which you have to select to actually get the result of the comparison:


```
var a = SIMD.Float32x4(0, 12, 3, 4);
var b = SIMD.Float32x4(0, 6, 7, 50);

var mask = SIMD.Float32x4.lessThan(a, b);
// Bool32x4[false, false, true, true]

var result = SIMD.Float32x4.select(mask, a, b);
// Float32x4[0, 6, 3, 4]
```

## Browser compatibility<a name="Browser_compatibility"></a>


Experimental SIMD.js has been removed from browsers. It&#39;s still available in Firefox Nightly, but will be removed in favor of a SIMD implementation in[WebAssembly]21620 ""). See also[bug 1416723]42510 "Consider removing SIMD.js?").
