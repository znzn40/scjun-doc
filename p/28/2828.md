The**`IDBOpenDBRequest`**interface of the IndexedDB API provides access to the results of requests to open or delete databases (performed using[`IDBFactory.open`](%13911 "If an error occurs while the database connection is being opened, then an error event is fired on the request object returned from this method.")and[`IDBFactory.deleteDatabase`](%13912 "If the database is successfully deleted, then a success event is fired on the request object returned from this method, with its result set to undefined. If an error occurs while the database is being deleted, then an error event is fired on the request object that is returned from this method.")), using specific event handler attributes.


**Note:**This feature is available in[Web Workers](%4334 "").

## Example<a name="Example"></a>


In the following example you can see the onupgradeneeded handler being used to update the database structure if a database with a higher version number is loaded. For a full working example, see our[To-do Notifications](%13672 "")app ([view example live](%13673 "").)


```
var db;

// Let us open our database
var DBOpenRequest = window.indexedDB.open("toDoList", 4);

// these event handlers act on the database being opened.
DBOpenRequest.onerror = function(event) {
  note.innerHTML += '<li>Error loading database.</li>';
};

DBOpenRequest.onsuccess = function(event) {
  note.innerHTML += '<li>Database initialised.</li>';
 
  // store the result of opening the database in the db
  // variable. This is used a lot below
  db = DBOpenRequest.result;
 
  // Run the displayData() function to populate the task
  // listwith all the to-do list data already in the IDB
  displayData();
};

// This event handles the event whereby a new version of
// the database needs to be created Either one has not
// been created before, or a new version number has been
// submitted via the window.indexedDB.open line above
// it is only implemented in recent browsers
DBOpenRequest.onupgradeneeded = function(event) {
  var db = this.result;
 
  db.onerror = function(event) {
    note.innerHTML += '<li>Error loading database.</li>';
  };

  // Create an objectStore for this database   
  var objectStore = db.createObjectStore("toDoList", { keyPath: "taskTitle" });

  // define what data items the objectStore will contain
    
  objectStore.createIndex("hours", "hours", { unique: false });
  objectStore.createIndex("minutes", "minutes", { unique: false });
  objectStore.createIndex("day", "day", { unique: false });
  objectStore.createIndex("month", "month", { unique: false });
  objectStore.createIndex("year", "year", { unique: false });
  objectStore.createIndex("notified", "notified", { unique: false });
};

* [Using IndexedDB](%13671 "")
* Starting transactions:[`IDBDatabase`](%13700 "The IDBDatabase interface of the IndexedDB API provides a connection to a database; you can use an IDBDatabase object to open a transaction on your database then create, manipulate, and delete objects (data) in that database. The interface provides the only way to get and manage versions of the database.")
* Using transactions:[`IDBTransaction`](%13701 "Note that as of Firefox 40, IndexedDB transactions have relaxed durability guarantees to increase performance (see bug 1112702.) Previously in a readwrite transaction IDBTransaction.oncomplete was fired only when all data was guaranteed to have been flushed to disk. In Firefox 40+ the complete event is fired after the OS has been told to write the data but potentially before that data has actually been flushed to disk. The complete event may thus be delivered quicker than before, however, there exists a small chance that the entire transaction will be lost if the OS crashes or there is a loss of system power before the data is flushed to disk. Since such catastrophic events are rare most consumers should not need to concern themselves further.")
* Setting a range of keys:[`IDBKeyRange`](%13702 "A key range can be a single value or a range with upper and lower bounds or endpoints. If the key range has both upper and lower bounds, then it is bounded; if it has no bounds, it is unbounded. A bounded key range can either be open (the endpoints are excluded) or closed (the endpoints are included). To retrieve all keys within a certain range, you can use the following code constructs:")
* Retrieving and making changes to your data:[`IDBObjectStore`](%13703 "This example shows a variety of different uses of object stores, from updating the data structure with IDBObjectStore.createIndex inside an onupgradeneeded function, to adding a new item to our object store with IDBObjectStore.add. For a full working example, see our To-do Notifications app (view example live.)")
* Using cursors:[`IDBCursor`](%13695 "The IDBCursor interface of the IndexedDB API represents a cursor for traversing or iterating over multiple records in a database.")
