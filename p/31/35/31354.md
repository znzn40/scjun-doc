**CSS Multi-column Layout**is a CSS module that adds support for multi-column layouts to CSS. Support is included for establishing the number of columns in a layout, as well as how content should flow from column to column, gap sizes, column dividing lines (known as column rules), and so forth.


## Basic example<a name="Basic_example"></a>


In the following example the column-count property has been applied to the element with a class of container. As the value of column-count is 3, the content is arranged into 3 columns of equal size.

## Relationship to Fragmentation<a name="Relationship_to_Fragmentation"></a>


Multiple-column Layout is closely related to[Paged Media]35577 ""), in that each column box becomes a fragment, much like a printed page becomes a fragment of an overall document. Therefore the properties now defined in the[CSS Fragmentation]29238 "")specification may be required in order to control how content breaks between columns.
