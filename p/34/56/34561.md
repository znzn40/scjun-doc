The[DOM]142 "DOM: The DOM (Document Object Model) is an API that represents and interacts with any HTML or XML document. The DOM is a document model loaded in the browser and representing the document as a node tree, where each node represents part of the document (e.g. an element, text string, or comment).")provides features that can test the results of a[media query]29770 "")programmatically, via the[`MediaQueryList`]14811 "A MediaQueryList object stores information on a media query applied to a document, and handles sending notifications to listeners when the media query state change (i.e. when the media query test starts or stops evaluating to true).")interface and its methods and properties. Once you&#39;ve created a[`MediaQueryList`]14811 "A MediaQueryList object stores information on a media query applied to a document, and handles sending notifications to listeners when the media query state change (i.e. when the media query test starts or stops evaluating to true).")object, you can check the result of the query or receive notifications when the result changes.


## Creating a media query list<a name="Creating_a_media_query_list"></a>


Before you can evaluate the results of a media query, you need to create the[`MediaQueryList`]14811 "A MediaQueryList object stores information on a media query applied to a document, and handles sending notifications to listeners when the media query state change (i.e. when the media query test starts or stops evaluating to true).")object representing the query. To do this, use the[`window.matchMedia`]14823 "Returns a new MediaQueryList object representing the parsed results of the specified media query string.")method.



For example, to set up a query list that determines if the device is in landscape or portrait orientation:


```
var mediaQueryList = window.matchMedia("(orientation: portrait)");
```

## Checking the result of a query<a name="Checking_the_result_of_a_query"></a>


Once you&#39;ve created your media query list, you can check the result of the query by looking at the value of its`matches`property:


```
if (mediaQueryList.matches) {
  /* The viewport is currently in portrait orientation */
} else {
  /* The viewport is not currently in portrait orientation, therefore landscape */
}
```

## Receiving query notifications<a name="Receiving_query_notifications"></a>


If you need to be aware of changes to the evaluated result of the query on an ongoing basis, it&#39;s more efficient to register a[listener]15701 "")than to poll the query&#39;s result. To do this, call the`addListener()`method on the[`MediaQueryList`]14811 "A MediaQueryList object stores information on a media query applied to a document, and handles sending notifications to listeners when the media query state change (i.e. when the media query test starts or stops evaluating to true).")object, with a callback function to invoke when the media query status changes (e.g., the media query test goes from`true`to`false`):


```
var mediaQueryList = window.matchMedia("(orientation: portrait)"); // Create the query list.
function handleOrientationChange(mql) { ... } // Define a callback function for the event listener.
mediaQueryList.addListener(handleOrientationChange); // Add the callback function as a listener to the query list.

handleOrientationChange(mediaQueryList); // Run the orientation change handler once.
```


This code creates the orientation-testing media query list, then adds an event listener to it. After adding the listener, we also call the listener directly. This makes our listener perform adjustments based on the current device orientation; otherwise, our code might assume the device is in portrait mode at startup, even if it&#39;s actually in landscape mode.



The`handleOrientationChange()`function would look at the result of the query and handle whatever we need to do on an orientation change:


```
function handleOrientationChange(evt) {
  if (evt.matches) {
    /* The viewport is currently in portrait orientation */
  } else {
    /* The viewport is currently in landscape orientation */
  }
}
```


Above, we define the parameter as`evt`— an event object. This makes sense because[newer implementations of`MediaQueryList`]38184 "")handle event listeners in a standard way. They no longer use the unusual[`MediaQueryListListener`]14824 "A MediaQueryList object maintains a list of media queries on a document, and handles sending notifications to listeners when the media queries on the document change.")mechanism, but a standard event listener setup, passing an[event object]3943 "")of type[`MediaQueryListEvent`]14810 "The MediaQueryListEvent object stores information on the changes that have happened to a MediaQueryList object — instances are available as the event object on a function referenced by a MediaQueryList.onchange property or MediaQueryList.addEvent() call.")as the argument to the callback function.



This event object also includes the[`media`]14816 "The media read-only property of the MediaQueryListEvent interface is a DOMString representing a serialized media query.")and[`match`]38185 "The documentation about this has not yet been written; please consider contributing!")properties, so you can query these features of the`MediaQueryList`by directly accessing it, or accessing the event object.


## Ending query notifications<a name="Ending_query_notifications"></a>


To stop receiving notifications about changes to the value of your media query, call`removeListener()`on the[`MediaQueryList`]14811 "A MediaQueryList object stores information on a media query applied to a document, and handles sending notifications to listeners when the media query state change (i.e. when the media query test starts or stops evaluating to true)."), passing it the name of the previously-defined callback function:


```
mediaQueryList.removeListener(handleOrientationChange);
```
