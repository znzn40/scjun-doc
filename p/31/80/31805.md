The**`initial`**CSS keyword applies the[initial (or default) value](%28552 "")of a property to an element. It can be applied to any CSS property.This includes the CSS shorthand[`all`](%29726 "The all CSS shorthand property sets all of an element's properties (other than unicode-bidi and direction) to their initial or inherited values, or to the values specified in another stylesheet origin."), with which`initial`can be used to restore all CSS properties to their initial state.



**Note:**On[inherited properties](%30600 ""), the initial value may be unexpected. You should consider using the[`inherit`](%31809 "The inherit CSS keyword causes the element for which it is specified to take the computed value of the property from its parent element."),[`unset`](%31808 "The unset CSS keyword resets a property to its inherited value if it inherits from its parent, and to its initial value if not. "), or[`revert`](%31804 "The revert CSS keyword rolls back the cascade so that a property takes on the value it would have had if there were no styles in the current style origin (author, user, or user-agent).")keywords instead.
