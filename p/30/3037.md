The**`RTCDTMFToneChangeEvent`**interface represents events sent to indicate that[DTMF](%16698 "DTMF: Dual-Tone Multi-Frequency (DTMF) signaling is a system by which audible tones are used to represent buttons being pressed on a keypad. Frequently referred to in the United States as "touch tone" (after the Touch-Tone trademark used when the transition from pulse dialing to DTMF began), DTMF makes it possible to signal the digits 0-9 as well as the letters "A" through "D" and the symbols "#" and "*". Few telephone keypads include the letters, which are typically used for control signaling by the telephone network.")tones have started or finished playing. This interface is used by the`[tonechange](%16703 "/en-US/docs/Web/Events/tonechange")`event.

<em>In addition to the properties of[`Event`](%3943 "The Event interface represents any event which takes place in the DOM; some are user-generated (such as mouse or keyboard events), while others are generated by APIs (such as events that indicate an animation has finished running, a video has been paused, and so forth). There are many types of events, some of which use other interfaces based on the main Event interface. Event itself contains the properties and methods which are common to all events."), this interface offers the following:</em>

This snippet is derived loosely from the full, working example you&#39;ll find in[When a tone finishes playing](%16721 "In order to more fully support audio/video conferencing, WebRTC supports sending DTMF to the remote peer on an RTCPeerConnection. This article offers a brief high-level overview of how DTMF works over WebRTC, then provides a guide for everyday developers about how to send DTMF over an RTCPeerConnection. The DTMF system is often referred to as "touch tone," after an old trade name for the system.")in[Using DTMF with WebRTC](%16710 "In order to more fully support audio/video conferencing, WebRTC supports sending DTMF to the remote peer on an RTCPeerConnection.

The DTMF system is often referred to as "touch tone," after an old trade name for the system."). It appends each tone to a display box as it&#39;s played, and, once all tones have been sent, re-enabled a previously-disabled &quot;Send&quot; button, allowing the next DMTF string to be entered.


```
dtmfSender.addEventListener("change", function(event) {
  if (event.tone !== "") {
    dialStringBox.innerText += event.tone;
  } else {
    sendDTMFButton.disabled = false;
