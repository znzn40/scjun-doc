**CSS Fonts**is a module of CSS that defines font-related properties and how font resources are loaded. It lets you define the style of a font, such as its family, size and weight, line height, and the glyph variants to use when multiple are available for a single character.

### Properties<a name="Properties"></a>

* [`font`](%23656 "The font CSS property is either a shorthand property for setting font-style, font-variant, font-weight, font-size, line-height, and font-family; or a way to set the element's font to a system font, using specific keywords.")
* [`font-family`](%33026 "The font-family CSS property specifies a prioritized list of one or more font family names and/or generic family names for the selected element.")
* [`font-feature-settings`](%33760 "The font-feature-settings CSS property gives you control over advanced typographic features in OpenType fonts.")
* [`font-kerning`](%30114 "The font-kerning CSS property controls the usage of the kerning information stored in a font.")
* [`font-language-override`](%30130 "The font-language-override CSS property controls the usage of language-specific glyphs in a typeface.")
* [`font-size`](%33511 "The font-size CSS property specifies the size of the font. Setting this property may change the size of other items, too, since it is used to compute the value of em, ex, and various other relative <length> units.")
* [`font-size-adjust`](%33762 "The font-size-adjust CSS property specifies that the font size should be chosen based on the height of lowercase letters rather than the height of capital letters. This is useful since the legibility of fonts, especially at small sizes, is determined more by the size of lowercase letters than by the size of capital letters.")
* [`font-stretch`](%33761 "The font-stretch CSS property selects a normal, condensed, or expanded face from a font.")
* [`font-style`](%33759 "The font-style CSS property specifies whether a font should be styled with a normal, italic, or oblique face from its font-family.")
* [`font-synthesis`](%30122 "The font-synthesis CSS property controls which missing typefaces, bold or italic, may be synthesized by the browser.")
* [`font-variant`](%30116 "The font-variant CSS property is a shorthand for the longhand properties font-variant-caps, font-variant-numeric, font-variant-alternates, font-variant-ligatures, and font-variant-east-asian. You can also set the CSS Level 2 (Revision 1) values of font-variant, (that is, normal or small-caps), by using the font shorthand.")
* [`font-variant-alternates`](%28550 "The font-variant-alternates CSS property controls the usage of alternate glyphs. These alternate glyphs may be referenced by alternative names defined in @font-feature-values.")
* [`font-variant-caps`](%30119 "The font-variant-caps CSS property controls the usage of alternate glyphs for capital letters.")
* [`font-variant-east-asian`](%30118 "The font-variant-east-asian CSS property controls the usage of alternate glyphs for East Asian scripts, like Japanese and Chinese.")
* [`font-variant-ligatures`](%30120 "The font-variant-ligatures CSS property controls which ligatures and contextual forms are used in textual content of the elements it applies to. This leads to more harmonized forms in the resulting text.")
* [`font-variant-numeric`](%30121 "The font-variant-numeric CSS property controls the usage of alternate glyphs for numbers, fractions, and ordinal markers.")
* [`font-variant-position`](%30117 "The font-variant-position CSS property controls the usage of alternate, smaller glyphs that are positioned as superscript or subscript relative to the baseline of the font (which remains unchanged). These glyphs are likely to be used in <sub> and <sup> elements.")
* [`font-weight`](%31392 "The font-weight CSS property specifies the weight (or boldness) of the font. The font weights available to you will depend on the font-family you are using. Some fonts are only available in normal and bold.")
* [`line-height`](%12926 "The line-height CSS property sets the amount of space used for lines, such as in text. On block-level elements, it specifies the minimum height of line boxes within the element. On non-replaced inline elements, it specifies the height that is used to calculate line box height.")

<dl><dt id=''>[`@font-face`](%26965 "The @font-face CSS at-rule allows authors to specify online fonts to display text on their web pages. By allowing authors to provide their own fonts, @font-face eliminates the need to depend on the limited number of fonts users have installed on their computers. The @font-face at-rule may be used not only at the top level of a CSS, but also inside any CSS conditional-group at-rule.")</dt><dd>
