**Media queries**let you adapt your site or app depending on the presence or value of various device characteristics and parameters.



They are a key component of[responsive design](%34557 ""). For example, a media query can shrink the font size on small devices, increase the padding between paragraphs when a page is viewed in portrait mode, or bump up the size of buttons on touchscreens.



In[CSS](%427 ""), use the[`@media`](%14285 "The @media CSS at-rule can be used to apply part of a style sheet based on the result of one or more media queries.")[at-rule](%4443 "")to conditionally apply part of a style sheet based on the result of a media query. Use[`@import`](%33622 "The @import CSS at-rule is used to import style rules from other style sheets. These rules must precede all other types of rules, except @charset rules; as it is not a nested statement, @import cannot be used inside conditional group at-rules.")to conditionally apply an entire style sheet.


### Media queries in HTML<a name="Media_queries_in_HTML"></a>


In[HTML](%12319 ""), media queries can be applied to various elements:


* In the[`<link>`](%24203 "The HTML <link> element specifies relationships between the current document and an external resource. Possible uses for this element include defining a relational framework for navigation. This element is most used to link to style sheets.")element&#39;s`[media](%34558 "")`attribute, they define the media to which a linked resource (typically CSS) should be applied.
* In the[`<source>`](%13219 "The HTML <source> element specifies multiple media resources for the <picture>, the <audio> element, or the <video> element. It is an empty element. It is commonly used to serve the same media content in multiple formats supported by different browsers.")element&#39;s`[media](%13222 "")`attribute, they define the media to which that source should be applied. (This is only valid inside[`<picture>`](%13119 "The HTML <picture> element serves as a container for zero or more <source> elements and one <img> element to provide versions of an image for different display device scenarios.")elements.)
* In the[`<style>`](%13253 "The HTML <style> element contains style information for a document, or part of a document.")element&#39;s`[media](%34559 "")`attribute, they define the media to which the style should be applied.

### Media queries in JavaScript<a name="Media_queries_in_JavaScript"></a>


In[JavaScript](%14321 ""), you can use the[`Window.matchMedia()`](%14823 "Returns a new MediaQueryList object representing the parsed results of the specified media query string.")method to test the window against a media query. You can also use[`MediaQueryList.addListener()`](%34560 "The addListener() method of the MediaQueryList interface adds a listener to the MediaQueryListener that will run a custom callback function in response to the media query status changing.")to be notified whenever the state of a query changes. With this functionality, your site or app can respond to changes in the device configuration, orientation, or state.



You can learn more about programmatically using media queries in[Testing media queries](%34561 "").
