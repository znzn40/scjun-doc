The`**location**`read-only property of the[`WorkerGlobalScope`](%4856 "The WorkerGlobalScope interface of the Web Workers API is an interface representing the scope of any worker. Workers have no browsing context; this scope contains the information usually conveyed by Window objects — in this case event handlers, the console or the associated WorkerNavigator object. Each WorkerGlobalScope has its own event loop.")interface returns the[`WorkerLocation`](%19270 "The WorkerLocation interface defines the absolute location of the script executed by the Worker. Such an object is initialized for each worker and is available via the WorkerGlobalScope.location property obtained by calling self.location.")associated with the worker. It is a specific location object, mostly a subset of the[`Location`](%24316 "The Location interface represents the location (URL) of the object it is linked to. Changes done on it are reflected on the object it relates to. Both the Document and Window interface have such a linked Location, accessible via Document.location and Window.location respectively.")for browsing scopes, but adapted to workers.


## Syntax<a name="Syntax"></a>

```
var locationObj = self.location;
```

### Value<a name="Value"></a>


A[`WorkerLocation`](%19270 "The WorkerLocation interface defines the absolute location of the script executed by the Worker. Such an object is initialized for each worker and is available via the WorkerGlobalScope.location property obtained by calling self.location.")object.


## Example<a name="Example"></a>


If you called the following in a document served at`localhost:8000`


```
console.log(location);
```


inside a worker (which would basically be the equivalent of`self.console.log(self.location);`, as these are being called on the worker scope, which can be referenced with[`WorkerGlobalScope.self`](%24306 "The self read-only property of the WorkerGlobalScope interface returns a reference to the WorkerGlobalScope itself. Most of the time it is a specific scope like DedicatedWorkerGlobalScope,  SharedWorkerGlobalScope, or ServiceWorkerGlobalScope.")), you will get a[`WorkerLocation`](%19270 "The WorkerLocation interface defines the absolute location of the script executed by the Worker. Such an object is initialized for each worker and is available via the WorkerGlobalScope.location property obtained by calling self.location.")object written to the console — something like the following:


```
WorkerLocation {hash: "", search: "", pathname: "/worker.js", port: "8000", hostname: "localhost"…}
  hash: ""
  host: "localhost:8000"
  hostname: "localhost"
  href: "http://localhost:8000/worker.js"
  origin: "http://localhost:8000"
  pathname: "/worker.js"
  port: "8000"
  protocol: "http:"
  search: ""
  __proto__: WorkerLocation
```


You could use this location object to return more information about the document&#39;s location, as you might do with a normal[`Location`](%24316 "The Location interface represents the location (URL) of the object it is linked to. Changes done on it are reflected on the object it relates to. Both the Document and Window interface have such a linked Location, accessible via Document.location and Window.location respectively.")object.



**Note**: Firefox has a bug with using`console.log`inside shared/service workers (see[bug 1058644](%24309 "FIXED: Console API doesn't work in SharedWorkers or ServiceWorkers")), which may return strange results, but this should be fixed soon.
