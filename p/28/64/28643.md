When laying out a document, the browser&#39;s rendering engine represents each element as a rectangular box according to the standard**CSS basic box model**. CSS determines the size, position, and properties (color, background, border size, etc.) of these boxes.



Every box is composed of four parts (or*areas*), defined by their respective edges: the*content edge*,*padding edge*,*border edge*, and*margin edge*.



![CSS Box model](%33797.png "")



The**content area**, bounded by the content edge, contains the &quot;real&quot; content of the element, such as text, an image, or a video player. Its dimensions are the*content width*(or*content-box width*) and the*content height*(or*content-box height*). It often has a background color or background image.



If the[`box-sizing`](%32988 "The box-sizing CSS property defines how the user agent should calculate the total width and height of an element.")property is set to`content-box`(default), the content area&#39;s size can be explicitly defined with the[`width`](%13333 "The width CSS property specifies the width of an element. By default, the property defines the width of the content area. If box-sizing is set to border-box, however, it instead determines the width of the border area."),[`min-width`](%14279 "The min-width CSS property sets the minimum width of an element. It prevents the used value of the width property from becoming smaller than the value specified for min-width."),[`max-width`](%14280 "The max-width CSS property sets the maximum width of an element. It prevents the used value of the width property from becoming larger than the value specified by max-width."),[`height`](%14278 "The height CSS property specifies the height of an element. By default, the property defines the height of the content area. If box-sizing is set to border-box, however, it instead determines the height of the border area."),[`min-height`](%14281 "The min-height CSS property sets the minimum height of an element. It prevents the used value of the height property from becoming smaller than the value specified for min-height."), and[`max-height`](%14282 "The max-height CSS property sets the maximum height of an element. It prevents the used value of the height property from becoming larger than the value specified for max-height.")properties.



The**padding area**, bounded by the padding edge, extends the content area to include the element&#39;s padding. Its dimensions are the*padding-box width*and the*padding-box height*.



The thickness of the padding is determined by the[`padding-top`](%31483 "The padding-top CSS property sets the height of the padding area on the top of an element."),[`padding-right`](%31484 "The padding-right CSS property sets the width of the padding area on the right side of an element."),[`padding-bottom`](%31485 "The padding-bottom CSS property sets the height of the padding area on the bottom of an element."),[`padding-left`](%31486 "The padding-left CSS property sets the width of the padding area on the left side of an element."), and shorthand[`padding`](%29242 "The padding CSS property sets the padding area on all four sides of an element. It is a shorthand for setting all individual paddings at once: padding-top, padding-right, padding-bottom, and padding-left.")properties.



The**border area**, bounded by the border edge, extends the padding area to include the element&#39;s borders. Its dimensions are the*border-box width*and the*border-box height*.



The thickness of the borders are determined by the[`border-width`](%28810 "The border-width CSS property is a shorthand property for setting the widths on all four sides of an element's border.")and shorthand[`border`](%29117 "The border CSS property is a shorthand for setting all individual border property values in a single declaration: border-width, border-style, and border-color.")properties. If the[`box-sizing`](%32988 "The box-sizing CSS property defines how the user agent should calculate the total width and height of an element.")property is set to`border-box`, the border area&#39;s size can be explicitly defined with the[`width`](%13333 "The width CSS property specifies the width of an element. By default, the property defines the width of the content area. If box-sizing is set to border-box, however, it instead determines the width of the border area."),[`min-width`](%14279 "The min-width CSS property sets the minimum width of an element. It prevents the used value of the width property from becoming smaller than the value specified for min-width."),[`max-width`](%14280 "The max-width CSS property sets the maximum width of an element. It prevents the used value of the width property from becoming larger than the value specified by max-width."),[`height`](%14278 "The height CSS property specifies the height of an element. By default, the property defines the height of the content area. If box-sizing is set to border-box, however, it instead determines the height of the border area."),[`min-height`](%14281 "The min-height CSS property sets the minimum height of an element. It prevents the used value of the height property from becoming smaller than the value specified for min-height."), and[`max-height`](%14282 "The max-height CSS property sets the maximum height of an element. It prevents the used value of the height property from becoming larger than the value specified for max-height.")properties. When there is a background ([`background-color`](%29451 "The background-color CSS property sets the background color of an element.")or[`background-image`](%29452 "The background-image CSS property sets one or more background images on an element.")) set on a box, it extends to the outer edge of the border (i.e. extends underneath the border in z-ordering). This default behavior can be altered with the[`background-clip`](%32976 "The background-clip CSS property specifies if an element's background, whether a <color> or an <image>, extends underneath its border.")css property.



The**margin area**, bounded by the margin edge, extends the border area to include an empty area used to separate the element from its neighbors. Its dimensions are the*margin-box width*and the*margin-box height*.



The size of the margin area is determined by the[`margin-top`](%30850 "The margin-top CSS property sets the margin area on the top of an element. A positive value will place it farther than normal from its neighbors, while a negative value will place it closer."),[`margin-right`](%30851 "The margin-right CSS property sets the margin area on the right side of an element. A positive value will place it farther than normal from its neighbors, while a negative value will place it closer."),[`margin-bottom`](%30852 "The margin-bottom CSS property sets the margin area on the bottom of an element. A positive value will place it farther than normal from its neighbors, while a negative value will place it closer."),[`margin-left`](%30853 "The margin-left CSS property sets the margin area on the left side of an element. A positive value will place it farther than normal from its neighbors, while a negative value will place it closer."), and shorthand[`margin`](%29241 "The margin CSS property sets the margin area on all four sides of an element. It is a shorthand for setting all individual margins at once: margin-top, margin-right, margin-bottom, and margin-left.")properties. When[margin collapsing](%30842 "en/CSS/margin_collapsing")occurs, the margin area is not clearly defined since margins are shared between boxes.



Finally, note that for non-replaced inline elements, the amount of space taken up (the contribution to the height of the line) is determined by the[`line-height`](%12926 "The line-height CSS property sets the amount of space used for lines, such as in text. On block-level elements, it specifies the minimum height of line boxes within the element. On non-replaced inline elements, it specifies the height that is used to calculate line box height.")property, even though the borders and padding are still displayed around the content.
