## NAME<a name="_name"></a>


git-whatchanged - Show logs with difference each commit introduces





## SYNOPSIS<a name="_synopsis"></a>

```
git whatchanged <option>…​
```




## DESCRIPTION<a name="_description"></a>


Shows commit logs and diff output each commit introduces.




New users are encouraged to use[git-log[1]](%2264  "")instead. The`whatchanged`command is essentially the same as[git-log[1]](%2264  "")but defaults to show the raw format diff output and to skip merges.




The command is kept primarily for historical reasons; fingers of many people who learned Git long before`git log`was invented by reading Linux kernel mailing list are trained to type it.
