* [`border`]29117 "The border CSS property is a shorthand property for setting all individual border property values at once: border-width, border-style, and border-color. As with all shorthand properties, any individual value that is not specified is set to its corresponding initial value. Importantly, border cannot be used to specify a custom value for border-image, but instead sets it to its initial value, i.e.,Â none.")
* [`visibility`]35131 "The visibility CSS property can show or hide an element without affecting the layout of a document (i.e., space is created for elements regardless of whether they are visible or not). The property can also hide rows or columns in a <table>.")
