## SVG string list interface<a name="SVG_string_list_interface"></a>


The`SVGStringList`defines a list of[`DOMString`](%3945 "DOMString is a UTF-16 String. As JavaScript already uses such strings, DOMString is mapped directly to a String.")objects.



An`SVGStringList`object can be designated as read only, which means that attempts to modify the object will result in an exception being thrown.

## Properties<a name="Properties"></a>
Name | Type | Description 
 ---  |  ---  |  ---  | 
`numberOfItems` | `unsigned long` | The number of items in the list. 
`length` | `unsigned long` | A mirror of the value in`numberOfItems`, for consistency with other interfaces.<i></i> 


## Methods<a name="Methods"></a>
Name &amp; Arguments | Return | Description 
 ---  |  ---  |  ---  | 
`**clear**()` | <em>void</em> | Clears all existing current items from the list, with the result being an empty list.



**Exceptions:**


* a[`DOMException`](%4502 "The DOMException interface represents an abnormal event (called an exception) which occurs as a result of calling a method or accessing a property of a web API.")with code`NO_MODIFICATION_ALLOWED_ERR`is raised when the list corresponds to a read only attribute or when the object itself is read only. 
`**initialize**(in[`DOMString`](%3945 "DOMString is a UTF-16 String. As JavaScript already uses such strings, DOMString is mapped directly to a String.")<em>newItem</em>)` | [`DOMString`](%3945 "DOMString is a UTF-16 String. As JavaScript already uses such strings, DOMString is mapped directly to a String.") | Clears all existing current items from the list and re-initializes the list to hold the single item specified by the parameter. If the inserted item is already in a list, it is removed from its previous list before it is inserted into this list. The inserted item is the item itself and not a copy. The return value is the item inserted into the list.



**Exceptions:**


* a[`DOMException`](%4502 "The DOMException interface represents an abnormal event (called an exception) which occurs as a result of calling a method or accessing a property of a web API.")with code`NO_MODIFICATION_ALLOWED_ERR`is raised when the list corresponds to a read only attribute or when the object itself is read only. 
`**getItem**(in unsigned long<em>index</em>)` | [`DOMString`](%3945 "DOMString is a UTF-16 String. As JavaScript already uses such strings, DOMString is mapped directly to a String.") | Returns the specified item from the list. The returned item is the item itself and not a copy. Any changes made to the item are immediately reflected in the list. The first item is number 0.



**Exceptions:**


* a[`DOMException`](%4502 "The DOMException interface represents an abnormal event (called an exception) which occurs as a result of calling a method or accessing a property of a web API.")with code`NO_MODIFICATION_ALLOWED_ERR`is raised when the list corresponds to a read only attribute or when the object itself is read only. 
`**insertItemBefore**(in[`DOMString`](%3945 "DOMString is a UTF-16 String.

As JavaScript already uses such strings, DOMString is mapped directly to a String.") | Inserts a new item into the list at the specified position. The first item is number 0. If`newItem`is already in a list, it is removed from its previous list before it is inserted into this list. The inserted item is the item itself and not a copy. If the item is already in this list, note that the index of the item to insert before is before the removal of the item. If the`index`is equal to 0, then the new item is inserted at the front of the list. If the index is greater than or equal to`numberOfItems`, then the new item is appended to the end of the list.



**Exceptions:**

`**replaceItem**(in[`DOMString`](%3945 "DOMString is a UTF-16 String.

As JavaScript already uses such strings, DOMString is mapped directly to a String.") | Replaces an existing item in the list with a new item. If`newItem`is already in a list, it is removed from its previous list before it is inserted into this list. The inserted item is the item itself and not a copy. If the item is already in this list, note that the index of the item to replace is before the removal of the item.

`**removeItem**(in unsigned long<em>index</em>)` | [`DOMString`](%3945 "DOMString is a UTF-16 String. As JavaScript already uses such strings, DOMString is mapped directly to a String.") | Removes an existing item from the list.
