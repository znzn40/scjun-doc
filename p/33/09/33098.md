* [`background`]28694 "The CSS background shorthand property lets you adjust all of the available background style options at once, including color image, origin and size, repeat method, and other features.")
* [`border`]29117 "The border CSS property is a shorthand property for setting all individual border property values at once: border-width, border-style, and border-color. As with all shorthand properties, any individual value that is not specified is set to its corresponding initial value.
