**This is an[experimental technology](%3404 "")**<br></br>Check the[Browser compatibility table](%4497 "")carefully before using this in production.





The**`CSSKeyframesRule`**interface describes an object representing a complete set of keyframes for a CSS animation. It corresponds to the contains of a whole[`@keyframes`](%4482 "The @keyframes CSS at-rule controls the intermediate steps in a CSS animation sequence by defining styles for keyframes (or waypoints) along the animation sequence.")[at-rule](%4483 ""). It implements the[`CSSRule`](%4433 "The CSSRule interface represents a single CSS rule. There are several types of rules, listed in the Type constants section below.")interface with a type value of`7`(`CSSRule.KEYFRAMES_RULE`).


## Properties<a name="Properties"></a>


As a[`CSSRule`](%4433 "The CSSRule interface represents a single CSS rule. There are several types of rules, listed in the Type constants section below."),`CSSKeyframesRule`also implements the properties of these interfaces. It has two properties :

<dl><dt>[`CSSKeyframesRule.name`](%4498 "The documentation about this has not yet been written; please consider contributing!")</dt><dd>Represents the name of the animation, used by the[`animation-name`](%4499 "The animation-name CSS property specifies one or more animations that should be applied to an element. Each name indicates an @keyframes at-rule that defines the property values for the animation sequence.")property.</dd><dt>[`CSSKeyframesRule.cssRules`](%4500 "The documentation about this has not yet been written; please consider contributing!")Read only</dt><dd>Returns a[`CSSRuleList`](%4475 "A CSSRuleList is an (indirect-modify only) array-like object containing an ordered collection of CSSRule objects.")of the CSS rules in the media rule.</dd></dl>
## Methods<a name="Methods"></a>


As a[`CSSRule`](%4433 "The CSSRule interface represents a single CSS rule. There are several types of rules, listed in the Type constants section below."),`CSSKeyframesRule`also implements the methods of that interface. It has three specific methods:

<dl><dt>[`CSSKeyframesRule.appendRule()`](%4501 "The documentation about this has not yet been written; please consider contributing!")</dt><dd>Inserts a new keyframe rule into the current CSSKeyframesRule. The parameter is a[`DOMString`](%3945 "DOMString is a UTF-16 String. As JavaScript already uses such strings, DOMString is mapped directly to a String.")containing a keyframe in the same format as an entry of a[`@keyframes`](%4482 "The @keyframes CSS at-rule controls the intermediate steps in a CSS animation sequence by defining styles for keyframes (or waypoints) along the animation sequence.")at-rule. If it contains more than one keyframe rule, a[`DOMException`](%4502 "The DOMException interface represents an abnormal event (called an exception) which occurs as a result of calling a method or accessing a property of a web API.")with a`SYNTAX_ERR`is thrown.</dd><dt>[`CSSKeyframesRule.deleteRule()`](%4503 "The documentation about this has not yet been written; please consider contributing!")</dt><dd>Deletes a keyframe rule from the current CSSKeyframesRule. The parameter is the index of the keyframe to be deleted, expressed as a[`DOMString`](%3945 "DOMString is a UTF-16 String. As JavaScript already uses such strings, DOMString is mapped directly to a String.")resolving as a number between`0`and`1`.</dd><dt>[`CSSKeyframesRule.findRule()`](%4504 "The documentation about this has not yet been written; please consider contributing!")</dt><dd>Returns a keyframe rule corresponding to the given key. The key is a[`DOMString`](%3945 "DOMString is a UTF-16 String. As JavaScript already uses such strings, DOMString is mapped directly to a String.")containing an index of the keyframe to be returned, resolving to a number between`0`and`1`. If no such keyframe exists,`findRule`returns`null`.</dd></dl>
