This example demonstrates both types of values for the`-ms-content-zoom-snap-points`property. In the first selector, the first snap-point is at 0%, and the interval is set to 100%. In the second selector, each snap-point is listed separatelyâ€”100%, 200%, 300%, and so on.


```
  
.snappy1 {
  -ms-content-zoom-snap-points: snapInterval(0%, 100%);
  ...
}

.snappy2 {
  -ms-content-zoom-snap-points: snapList(100%, 200%, 300%, 400%, 500%);
  ...
}
  

```

Not part of any specification.


## Remarks<a name="Remarks"></a>


This property has no effect on non-zoomable elements. See[`-ms-content-zooming`]33339 "The -ms-content-zooming CSS property is a Microsoft extension that specifies whether zooming is enabled.")for details on zoomable elements.



When a user pans or scrolls and then lifts his or her contact (for instance, a finger), the content can continue to move with inertia. Snap-points can change the animation that runs when the user lifts his or her finger so that you can adjust where the content will stop. By placing snap-points, you can make it easy for your users to manipulate your content and make it stop at convenient or key places.



Starting with Windows 8.1, this property is also supported for touchpad interaction.



This property requires Windows 8 or later.
