**Non-standard**<br></br>This feature is non-standard and is not on a standards track. Do not use it on production sites facing the Web: it will not work for every user. There may also be large incompatibilities between implementations and the behavior may change in the future.





The**`:-moz-first-node`**[CSS]427 "")[pseudo-class]29702 "")is a[Mozilla extension]28318 "")that represents any element that is the first child node of some other element. It differs from[`:first-child`]34508 "The :first-child CSS pseudo-class represents the first element among a group of sibling elements.")because it does not match a first-child element with (non-whitespace) text before it.



**Note:**Any whitespace at the start of an element is ignored for the determination of`:-moz-first-node`.
