### Values<a name="Values"></a>


Note: a`<length-percentage>`is a value that can be either a[`<length>`]4561 "The <length> CSS data type represents a distance value. Lengths can be used in numerous CSS properties, such as width, height, margin, padding, border-width, font-size, and text-shadow.")or a[`<percentaqe>`]37374 "The documentation about this has not yet been written; please consider contributing!").


<dl><dt id=''>`snapInterval( <length-percentage>, <length-percentage> )`</dt><dd>

Specifies a starting snap-point followed by the interval between all snap-points.


* The first value specifies where the first snap-point will be placed.
* The second value specifies the distance between subsequent snap-points both above and below the initial snap-point.
</dd><dt id=''>`snapList( <length-percentage># )`</dt><dd>

Specifies the position of individual snap-points as a comma-separated list of values, each of which represents a zoom factor.


* If any value is less than[`-ms-scroll-limit-y-min`]33368 "The -ms-scroll-limit-y-min CSS property is a Microsoft extension that specifies the minimum value for the Element.scrollTop property."), then[`-ms-scroll-limit-y-min`]33368 "The -ms-scroll-limit-y-min CSS property is a Microsoft extension that specifies the minimum value for the Element.scrollTop property.")is used.
* If any value is greater than[`-ms-scroll-limit-y-max`]33367 "The -ms-scroll-limit-y-max CSS property is a Microsoft extension that specifies the maximum value for the Element.scrollTop property."), then[`-ms-scroll-limit-y-max`]33367 "The -ms-scroll-limit-y-max CSS property is a Microsoft extension that specifies the maximum value for the Element.scrollTop property.")is used.

This example demonstrates both types of values for the`-ms-scroll-snap-points-y`property. In the first selector, the first snap-point is at 0%, and the interval is set to 100%. In the second selector, each snap-point is listed separately â€” 100%, 200%, 300%, and so on. (The`-ms-scroll-snap-points-y`property behaves identically to the[`-ms-scroll-snap-points-x`]33370 "The -ms-scroll-snap-points-x CSS property is a Microsoft extension that specifies where snap-points will be located along the x-axis.")property, but along the y-axis.)
