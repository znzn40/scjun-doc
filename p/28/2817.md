**Important**: As of Firefox 52, the property defined in this mixin has been moved to the[`WindowOrWorkerGlobalScope`](%13756 "The WindowOrWorkerGlobalScope mixin describes several features common to the Window and WorkerGlobalScope interfaces. Each of these interfaces can, of course, add more features in addition to the ones listed below.")mixin, and other browsers will follow suit. Look to that page for up-to-date details.




The**`IDBEnvironment`**helper of the[IndexedDB API](%13656 "")contains the`indexedDB`property, which provides access to IndexedDB functionality. It is the top level IndexedDB interface implemented by the[`window`](%13757 "The window object represents a window containing a DOM document; the document property points to the DOM document loaded in that window.")and[`Worker`](%4847 "The Worker interface of the Web Workers API represents a background task that can be easily created and can send messages back to its creator. Creating a worker is as simple as calling the Worker() constructor and specifying a script to be run in the worker thread.")objects.

**Note:**This feature is available in[Web Workers](%4334 "").

<dl><dt>[`IDBEnvironment.indexedDB`](%13758 "The documentation about this has not yet been written; please consider contributing!")Read only</dt><dd>Provides a mechanism for applications to asynchronously access capabilities of indexed databases; contains an[`IDBFactory`](%13759 "In the following code snippet, we make a request to open a database, and include handlers for the success and error cases. For a full working example, see our To-do Notifications app (view example live.)")object.</dd></dl>
## Example<a name="Example"></a>


The following code creates a request for a database to be opened asychronously, after which the database is opened when the request&#39;s`onsuccess`handler is fired:


```
var db;
function openDB() {
 var DBOpenRequest = window.indexedDB.open("toDoList");
 DBOpenRequest.onsuccess = function(e) {
   db = DBOpenRequest.result;
 };
}

* [Using IndexedDB](%13671 "")
* Starting transactions:[`IDBDatabase`](%13700 "The IDBDatabase interface of the IndexedDB API provides a connection to a database; you can use an IDBDatabase object to open a transaction on your database then create, manipulate, and delete objects (data) in that database. The interface provides the only way to get and manage versions of the database.")
* Using transactions:[`IDBTransaction`](%13701 "Note that as of Firefox 40, IndexedDB transactions have relaxed durability guarantees to increase performance (see bug 1112702.) Previously in a readwrite transaction IDBTransaction.oncomplete was fired only when all data was guaranteed to have been flushed to disk. In Firefox 40+ the complete event is fired after the OS has been told to write the data but potentially before that data has actually been flushed to disk. The complete event may thus be delivered quicker than before, however, there exists a small chance that the entire transaction will be lost if the OS crashes or there is a loss of system power before the data is flushed to disk. Since such catastrophic events are rare most consumers should not need to concern themselves further.")
* Setting a range of keys:[`IDBKeyRange`](%13702 "A key range can be a single value or a range with upper and lower bounds or endpoints. If the key range has both upper and lower bounds, then it is bounded; if it has no bounds, it is unbounded. A bounded key range can either be open (the endpoints are excluded) or closed (the endpoints are included). To retrieve all keys within a certain range, you can use the following code constructs:")
* Retrieving and making changes to your data:[`IDBObjectStore`](%13703 "This example shows a variety of different uses of object stores, from updating the data structure with IDBObjectStore.createIndex inside an onupgradeneeded function, to adding a new item to our object store with IDBObjectStore.add. For a full working example, see our To-do Notifications app (view example live.)")
* Using cursors:[`IDBCursor`](%13695 "The IDBCursor interface of the IndexedDB API represents a cursor for traversing or iterating over multiple records in a database.")
