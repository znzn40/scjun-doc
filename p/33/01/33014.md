The**`transition`**[CSS](%28350 "CSS")property is a[shorthand property](%28797 "/en-US/docs/CSS/Shorthand_properties")for[`transition-property`](%33017 "The transition-property CSS property specifies the CSS properties to which a transition effect should be applied."),[`transition-duration`](%33016 "The transition-duration CSS property specifies the number of seconds or milliseconds a transition animation should take to complete. By default, the value is 0s, meaning that no animation will occur."),[`transition-timing-function`](%33018 "The transition-timing-function CSS property is used to describe how the intermediate values of the CSS properties being affected by a transition effect are calculated."), and[`transition-delay`](%33015 "The transition-delay CSS property specifies the amount of time to wait before starting a property's transition effect when its value changes.").

Transitions enable you to define the transition between two states of an element. Different states may be defined using[pseudo-classes](%29702 "/en-US/docs/CSS/Pseudo-classes")like[`:hover`](%34496 "The :hover CSS pseudo-class matches when the user interacts with an element with a pointing device, but does not necessarily activate it. It is generally triggered when the user hovers over an element with the cursor (mouse pointer).")or[`:active`](%34499 "The :active CSS pseudo-class represents an element (such as a button) that is being activated by the user.")or dynamically set using JavaScript.


## **Syntax**<a name="Syntax"></a>

```
/* Apply to 1 property */
/* property name | duration */
transition: margin-right 4s;

/* property name | duration | delay */
transition: margin-right 4s 1s;

/* property name | duration | timing function */
transition: margin-right 4s ease-in-out;

/* property name | duration | timing function | delay */
transition: margin-right 4s ease-in-out 1s;

/* Apply to 2 properties */
transition: margin-right 4s, color 1s;

/* Apply to all changed properties */
transition: all 0.5s ease-out;

/* Global values */
transition: inherit;
transition: initial;
transition: unset;
```


The`transition`property is specified as one or more single-property transitions, separated by commas.



Each single-property transition describes the transition that should be applied to a single property (or the special values`all`and`none`). It includes:


* zero or one value representing the property to which the transition should apply. This may be any one of:
	* the keyword`none`
	* the keyword`all`
	* a[`<custom-ident>`](%28326 "The <custom-ident> CSS data type denotes an arbitrary user-defined string used as an identifier. It is case-sensitive, and certain values are forbidden in various contexts to prevent ambiguity.")naming a CSS property.
* zero or one[`<single-transition-timing-function>`](%28336 "The <single-transition-timing-function> CSS data type denotes a mathematical function that describes how fast one-dimensional values change during animations. This lets you vary the animation's speed over the course of its duration.")value representing the timing function to use
* zero, one, or two[`<time>`](%4566 "The <time> CSS data type represents a time value expressed in seconds or milliseconds. It is used in animation, transition, and related properties.")values. The first value that can be parsed as a time is assigned to the[`transition-duration`](%33016 "The transition-duration CSS property specifies the number of seconds or milliseconds a transition animation should take to complete. By default, the value is 0s, meaning that no animation will occur."), and the second value that can be parsed as a time is assigned to[`transition-delay`](%33015 "The transition-delay CSS property specifies the amount of time to wait before starting a property's transition effect when its value changes.").


See[how things are handled](%36698 "en/CSS/CSS transitions#When property value lists are of different lengths")when lists of property values aren&#39;t the same length. In short, extra transition descriptions beyond the number of properties actually being animated are ignored.
