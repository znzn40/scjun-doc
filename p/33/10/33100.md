* [`border`]29117 "The border CSS property is a shorthand property for setting all individual border property values at once: border-width, border-style, and border-color. As with all shorthand properties, any individual value that is not specified is set to its corresponding initial value. Importantly, border cannot be used to specify a custom value for border-image, but instead sets it to its initial value, i.e.,Â none.")
* [`display`]30836 "The display CSS property specifies the type of rendering box used for an element. In HTML, default display property values are taken from behaviors described in the HTML specifications or from the browser/user default stylesheet. The default value in XML is inline, including SVG elements.")
* [`-moz-appearance`]32974 "The -moz-appearance CSS property is used in Gecko (Firefox) to display an element using platform-native styling based on the operating system's theme.")
