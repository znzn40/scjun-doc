**<dfn>Shorthand properties</dfn>**are CSS properties that let you set the values of multiple other CSS properties simultaneously. Using a shorthand property, you can write more concise (and often more readable) style sheets, saving time and energy.



The CSS specification defines shorthand properties to group the definition of common properties acting on the same theme. For instance, the CSS[`background`](%28694 "The background CSS property is a short way to declare all background style options at once, including color, image, origin and size, repeat method, and other features.")property is a shorthand property that&#39;s able to define the values of[`background-color`](%29451 "The background-color CSS property sets the background color of an element."),[`background-image`](%29452 "The background-image CSS property sets one or more background images on an element."),[`background-repeat`](%29243 "The background-repeat CSS property defines how background images are repeated. A background image can be repeated along the horizontal axis, the vertical axis, both axes, or not repeated at all."), and[`background-position`](%30971 "The background-position CSS property sets the initial position, relative to the background position layer defined by background-origin, for each defined background image."). Similarly, the most common font-related properties can be defined using the shorthand[`font`](%23656 "The font CSS property is either a shorthand property for setting font-style, font-variant, font-weight, font-size, line-height, and font-family; or a way to set the element's font to a system font, using specific keywords."), and the different margins around a box can be defined using the[`margin`](%29241 "The margin CSS property sets the margin area on all four sides of an element. It is a shorthand for setting all individual margins at once: margin-top, margin-right, margin-bottom, and margin-left.")shorthand.


## Tricky edge cases<a name="Tricky_edge_cases"></a>


Even if they are very convenient to use, there are a few edge cases to keep in mind when using them:


1. A value which is not specified is set to its initial value. That sounds anecdotal, but it really means that it**overrides**previously set values. Therefore:
```
background-color: red;
background: url(images/bg.gif) no-repeat left top;
```
will not set the color of the background to`red`but to[`background-color`](%29451 "The background-color CSS property sets the background color of an element.")&#39;s default,`transparent`, as the second rule has precedence.
1. Only the individual properties values can inherit. As missing values are replaced by their initial value, it is impossible to allow inheritance of individual properties by omitting them. The keyword`inherit`can be applied to a property, but only as a whole, not as a keyword for one value or another. That means that the only way to make some specific value to be inherited is to use the longhand property with the keyword`inherit`.
1. Shorthand properties try not to force a specific order for the values of the properties they replace. This works well when these properties use values of different types, as the order has no importance, but this does not work as easily when several properties can have identical values. Handling of these cases are grouped in several categories:
	1. Shorthands handling properties related to edges of a box, like[`border-style`](%28815 "The border-style CSS property is a shorthand property that sets the line style for all four sides of an element's border."),[`margin`](%29241 "The margin CSS property sets the margin area on all four sides of an element. It is a shorthand for setting all individual margins at once: margin-top, margin-right, margin-bottom, and margin-left.")or[`padding`](%29242 "The padding CSS property sets the padding area on all four sides of an element. It is a shorthand for setting all individual paddings at once: padding-top, padding-right, padding-bottom, and padding-left."), always use a consistent 1-to-4-value syntax representing those edges:
![border1.png](%32839 "") | *The 1-value syntax*:`border-width: 1em`— The unique value represents all edges 
![border2.png](%32840 "") | *The 2-value syntax*:`border-width: 1em 2em`— The first value represents the vertical, that is top and bottom, edges, the second the horizontal ones, that is the left and right ones. 
![border3.png](%32841 "") | *The 3-value syntax*:`border-width: 1em 2em 3em`— The first value represents the top edge, the second, the horizontal, that is left and right, ones, and the third value the bottom edge 
![border4.png](%32842 "") | *The 4-value syntax*:`border-width: 1em 2em 3em 4em`— The four values represent the top, right, bottom and left edges respectively, always in that order, that is clock-wise starting at the top (The initial letter of Top-Right-Bottom-Left matches the order of the consonant of the word*trouble*: TRBL)
	1. Similarly, shorthands handling properties related to corners of a box, like[`border-radius`](%28741 "The border-radius CSS property lets you round the corners of an element's outer border edge. You can specify a single radius to make circular corners, or two radii to make elliptical corners."), always use a consistent 1-to-4-value syntax representing those corners:
![corner1.png](%32843 "") | *The 1-value syntax*:`border-radius: 1em`— The unique value represents all corners 
![corner2.png](%32844 "") | *The 2-value syntax*:`border-radius: 1em 2em`— The first value represents the top left and bottom right corner, the second the top right and bottom left ones. 
![corner3.png](%32845 "") | *The 3-value syntax*:`border-radius: 1em 2em 3em`— The first value represents the top left corner, the second the top right and bottom left ones, and the third value the bottom right corner 
![corner4.png](%32846 "") | *The 4-value syntax*:`border-radius: 1em 2em 3em 4em`— The four values represent the top left, top right, bottom right and bottom left corners respectively, always in that order, that is clock-wise starting at the top left.

## Background properties<a name="Background_Properties"></a>


A background with the following properties ...


```
background-color: #000;
background-image: url(images/bg.gif);
background-repeat: no-repeat;
background-position: left top;
```


... can be shortened to just one declaration:


```
background: #000 url(images/bg.gif) no-repeat left top;
```


(The shorthand form is actually the equivalent of the longhand properties above plus`background-attachment: scroll`and, in CSS3, some additional properties.)



See[`background`](%28694 "The background CSS property is a short way to declare all background style options at once, including color, image, origin and size, repeat method, and other features.")for more detailed information, including CSS3 properties.


## Font properties<a name="Font_Properties"></a>


The following declarations ...


```
font-style: italic;
font-weight: bold;
font-size: .8em;
line-height: 1.2;
font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
```


... can be shortened to the following:


```
font: italic bold .8em/1.2 Arial, sans-serif;
```


This shorthand declaration is actually equivalent to the longhand declarations above plus`font-variant: normal`and`font-size-adjust: none`(CSS2.0 / CSS3),`font-stretch: normal`(CSS3).


## Border properties<a name="Border_Properties"></a>


With borders, the width, color, and style can be simplified into one declaration. For example, the following CSS ...


```
border-width: 1px;
border-style: solid;
border-color: #000;
```


... can be simplified as:


```
border: 1px solid #000;
```

## Margin and padding properties<a name="Margin_and_Padding_Properties"></a>


Shorthand versions of margin and padding values work the same way. The following CSS declarations ...


```
margin-top: 10px;
margin-right: 5px;
margin-bottom: 10px;
margin-left: 5px;
```


... are the same as the following declaration. Note that the values are in clockwise order, beginning at the top: top, right, bottom, then left (TRBL, the consonants in &quot;trouble&quot;).


```
margin: 10px 5px 10px 5px;
```

## The universal shorthand property<a name="The_universal_shorthand_property"></a>


CSS provides a universal shorthand property,[`all`](%29726 "The all CSS shorthand property sets all of an element's properties (other than unicode-bidi and direction) to their initial or inherited values, or to the values specified in another stylesheet origin."), which applies its value to every property in the document. Its purpose is to change the properties&#39; inheritance model to one of:



CSS provides four special universal property values for specifying inheritance:

<dl><dt id=''>[`inherit`](%31809 "The inherit CSS keyword causes the element for which it is specified to take the computed value of the property from its parent element.")</dt><dd>Sets the property value applied to a selected element to be the same as that of its parent element.</dd><dt id=''>[`initial`](%31805 "The initial CSS keyword applies the initial (or default) value of a property to an element. It can be applied to any CSS property.")</dt><dd>Sets the property value applied to a selected element to be the same as the value set for that element in the browser&#39;s default style sheet. If no value is set by the browser&#39;s default style sheet and the property is naturally inherited, then the property value is set to`inherit`instead.</dd><dt id=''>[`unset`](%31808 "The unset CSS keyword resets a property to its inherited value if it inherits from its parent, and to its initial value if not. ")</dt><dd>Resets the property to its natural value, which means that if the property is naturally inherited it acts like`inherit`, otherwise it acts like`initial`.</dd><dt id=''>[`revert`](%31804 "The revert CSS keyword rolls back the cascade so that a property takes on the value it would have had if there were no styles in the current style origin (author, user, or user-agent).")</dt><dd>Reverts the property to the value it would have had if the current origin had not applied any styles to it. In other words, the property&#39;s value is set to the user stylesheet&#39;s value for the property (if one is set), otherwise the property&#39;s value is taken from the user-agent&#39;s default stylesheet.</dd></dl>

**Note**:`initial`and`unset`are not supported in Internet Explorer.




Of these,`inherit`is frequently the most interesting — it allows us to explicitly make an element inherit a property value from its parent.



Let&#39;s take a look at an example. First some HTML:


```
<ul>
  <li>Default <a href="#">link</a> color</li>
  <li class="inherit">Inherit the <a href="#">link</a> color</li>
  <li class="initial">Reset the <a href="#">link</a> color</li>
  <li class="unset">Unset the <a href="#">link</a> color</li>
</ul>
```


Now some CSS for styling:


```
body {
  color: green;
}

.inherit a {
  color: inherit;
}

.initial a {
  color: initial;
}

.unset a {
  color: unset;
}
```


Result:

Let&#39;s explain what&#39;s going on here:


* We first set the[`color`](%28820 "The color CSS property sets the foreground color value of an element's text content and text decorations. It also sets the currentcolor value, which may be used as an indirect value on other properties, and is the default for other color properties, such as border-color.")of the[`<body>`](%22830 "The HTML <body> Element represents the content of an HTML document. There can be only one <body> element in a document.")to green.
* As the`color`property is naturally inherited, all child elements of body will have the same green color. It&#39;s worth noting that browsers set the color of links to blue by default instead of allowing the natural inheritance of the color property, so the first link in our list is blue.
* The second rule sets links within an element with the class`inherit`to inherit its color from its parent. In this case, it means that the link inherits its color from its[`<li>`](%12761 "The HTML <li> element is used to represent an item in a list. It must be contained in a parent element: an ordered list (<ol>), an unordered list (<ul>), or a menu (<menu>). In menus and unordered lists, list items are usually displayed using bullet points. In ordered lists, they are usually displayed with an ascending counter on the left, such as a number or letter.")parent, which, by default inherits its color from its own[`<ul>`](%13566 "The HTML <ul> element represents an unordered list of items, typically rendered as a bulleted list.")parent, which ultimately inherits its color from the[`<body>`](%22830 "The HTML <body> Element represents the content of an HTML document. There can be only one <body> element in a document.")element, which had its[`color`](%28820 "The color CSS property sets the foreground color value of an element's text content and text decorations. It also sets the currentcolor value, which may be used as an indirect value on other properties, and is the default for other color properties, such as border-color.")set to`green`by the first rule.
* The third rule selects any links within an element with the class`initial`and sets their color to`initial`. Usually, the initial value set by browsers for the text color is black, so this link is set to black.
* The last rule selects all links within an element with the class`unset`and sets their color to`unset`— we unset the value. Because the color property is a naturally inherited property it acts exactly like setting the value to`inherit`. As a consequence, this link is set to the same color as the body — green.
