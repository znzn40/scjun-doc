A CSS**pseudo-element**is a keyword added to a selector that lets you style a specific part of the selected element(s). For example,[`::first-line`](%28554 "The ::first-line CSS pseudo-element applies styles to the first line of a block-level element.")can be used to change the font of the first line of a paragraph.


```
/* The first line of every <p> element. */
p::first-line {
  color: blue;
  text-transform: uppercase;
}
```


**Note:**In contrast to pseudo-elements,[`pseudo-classes`](%33702 "A CSS pseudo-class is a keyword added to a selector that specifies a special state of the selected element(s). For example, :hover can be used to change a button's color when the user hovers over it.")can be used to style an element based on its*state*.



## Syntax<a name="Syntax"></a>

```
selector::pseudo-element {
  property: value;
}
```


You can use only one pseudo-element in a selector. It must appear after the simple selectors in the statement.



**Note:**As a rule, double colons (`::`) should be used instead of a single colon (`:`). This distinguishes pseudo-classes from pseudo-elements. However, since this distinction was not present in older versions of the W3C spec, most browsers support both syntaxes for the original pseudo-elements.
