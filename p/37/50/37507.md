The**`repeating-linear-gradient()`**[CSS]427 "")function creates an image consisting of repeating linear gradients. It is similar to[`linear-gradient()`]33477 "The linear-gradient() CSS function creates an image consisting of a progressive transition between two or more colors along a straight line. Its result is an object of the <gradient> data type, which is a special kind of <image>.")and takes the same arguments, but it repeats the color stops infinitely in all directions so as to cover its entire container. The function&#39;s result is an object of the[`<gradient>`]28329 "The <gradient> CSS data type is a special type of <image> that consists of a progressive transition between two or more colors.")data type, which is a special kind of[`<image>`]28330 "The <image> CSS data type represents a two-dimensional image. There are two kinds of images: plain images, referenced with a <url>, and dynamically-generated images, generated with <gradient> or element(). Images can be used with numerous CSS properties, such as background-image, border-image, content, cursor, and list-style-image.").

With each repetition, the positions of the color stops are shifted by a multiple of the length of the basic linear gradient (the distance between the last color stop and the first). Thus, the position of each ending color stop coincides with a starting color stop; if the color values are different, this will result in a sharp visual transition.



As with any gradient, a repeating linear gradient has[no intrinsic dimensions]30309 ""); i.e., it has no natural or preferred size, nor a preferred ratio. Its concrete size will match the size of the element it applies to.



Because`<gradient>`s belong to the`<image>`data type, they can only be used where`<image>`s can be used. For this reason,`repeating-linear-gradient()`won&#39;t work on[`background-color`]29451 "The background-color CSS property sets the background color of an element.")and other properties that use the[`<color>`]4569 "The <color> CSS data type represents a color in the sRGB color space. A <color> may also include an alpha-channel transparency value, indicating how the color should composite with its background.")data type.

[1] Internet Explorer 5.5 through 9.0 supports proprietary[`filter: progid:DXImageTransform.Microsoft.Gradient()`filter]30772 "").



[2] WebKit since 528 supports the legacy[`-webkit-gradient(linear,â¦)`function]30771 ""). As of WebKit 534.16, it also supports the standard gradient syntax. Unlike in Gecko, in legacy WebKit you cannot specify both a position and angle in`-webkit-linear-gradient()`. You can achieve the same effect by offsetting the color stops.



[3] Gecko, Opera &amp; Webkit considers[`<angle>`]4563 "The <angle> CSS data type represents an angle value expressed in degrees, gradians, radians, or turns. It is used, for example, in <gradient>s and in some transform functions.")to start to the right, instead of the top. I.e. it considered an angle of`0deg`as a direction indicator pointing to the right. This is different from the latest specification where an angle of`0deg`as a direction indicator points to the top. Since Firefox 42, the prefixed version of gradients can be disabled by setting`layout.css.prefixes.gradients`to`false`.



[4] Firefox 3.6 and Opera 11.10 implemented, prefixed, an early syntax where the starting corner or side was indicated without the`to`keyword, and effectively considered as a*from*position. The`to`syntax has been added in Firefox 10 and Opera 11.60 , at first without removing the deprecated syntax and translation between the two is trivial:


```
-moz-repeating-linear-gradient(to top left, blue, red);
```


is the same as:


```
-moz-repeating-linear-gradient(bottom right, blue, red);
```


The legacy syntax, without`to`, is planned to go away when the prefix is removed.



[5] Before Firefox 36, Gecko didn&#39;t apply gradient on the pre-multiplied color space, leading to shade of grey unexpectedly appearing when used with transparency.



[6][WebKit bug 1074056]31772 "").



[7] In addition to the unprefixed support using the standard syntax, Gecko 44.0 (Firefox 44.0 / Thunderbird 44.0 / SeaMonkey 2.41) added support for a`-webkit`prefixed version of the function using the legacy &#39;from&#39; syntax for web compatibility reasons behind the preference`layout.css.prefixes.webkit`, defaulting to`false`. Since Gecko 49.0 (Firefox 49.0 / Thunderbird 49.0 / SeaMonkey 2.46) the preference defaults to`true`.



[8] In`-webkit-linear-gradient`function (handled below), Gecko accept unitless 0 for angles, to match webkit/blink,See[bug 1239153]30773 "FIXED: Firefox's CSS parser rejects "-webkit-linear-gradient(0,pink,teal)"").



[9] See[bug 1363292]31773 "FIXED: Zero (0) angle value without degree unit is not correctly interpreted in linear-gradient").
