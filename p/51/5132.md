The**`create()`**method of the[`CredentialsContainer`]23994 "The CredentialsContainer interface of the the Credential Management API exposes methods to request credentials and notify the user agent when events such as successful sign in or sign out happen. This interface is accessible from Navigator.credentials.")interface returns a[`Promise`]4237 "The Promise object represents the eventual completion (or failure) of an asynchronous operation, and its resulting value.")that resolves with a new[`Credential`]5112 "The Credential interface of the the Credential Management API provides information about an entity as a prerequisite to a trust decision.")instance based on the provided options, or`null`if no`Credential`object can be created.



This method is restricted to top-level contexts. Calls to it within an`<iframe>`element will resolve without effect.
