The**`stroke`**attribute is a presentation attribute defining the color (*or any SVG paint servers like gradients or patterns*) used to paint the outline of the shape;



**Note:**As a presentation attribute`stroke`can be used as a CSS property.



As a presentation attribute, it can be applied to any element but it has effect only on the following eleven elements:[`<altGlyph>`]38642 "The <altGlyph> SVG element allows sophisticated selection of the glyphs used to render its child character data."),[`<circle>`]18195 "The <circle> SVG element is an SVG basic shape, used to create circles based on a center point and a radius."),[`<ellipse>`]17568 "The <ellipse> element is an SVG basic shape, used to create ellipses based on a center coordinate, and both their x and y radius."),[`<path>`]38643 "The <path> SVG element is the generic element to define a shape. All the basic shapes can be created with a path element."),[`<polygon>`]18098 "The <polygon> element defines a closed shape consisting of a set of connected straight line segments. The last point is connected to the first point. For open shapes see theÂ <polyline> element."),[`<polyline>`]18103 "The <polyline> SVG element is an SVG basic shape that creates straight lines connecting several points. Typically a polyline is used to create open shapes as the last point doesn't have to be connected to the first point. For closed shapes see the <polygon> element."),[`<rect>`]18128 "The <rect> element is a basic SVG shape that creates rectangles, defined by their corner's position, their width, and their height. The rectangles may have their corners rounded."),[`<text>`]18290 "The SVG <text> element defines a graphics element consisting of text. It's possible to apply a gradient, pattern, clipping path, mask, or filter to <text>, just like any other SVG graphics element."),[`<textPath>`]18295 "In addition to text drawn in a straight line, SVG also includes the ability to place text along the shape of a <path> element. To specify that a block of text is to be rendered along the shape of a <path>, include the given text within a <textPath> element which includes an href attribute with a reference to a <path> element."),[`<tref>`]18249 "The textual content for a <text> SVG element can be either character data directly embedded within the <text> element or the character data content of a referenced element, where the referencing is specified with a <tref> element."), and[`<tspan>`]18255 "Within a <text> element, text and font properties and the current text position can be adjusted with absolute or relative coordinate values by including a <tspan> element.")

**Note:**For information on using the non-standard and restricted`context-stroke`(and`context-fill`) value see the documentation for the[`-moz-context-properties`]32945 "If you reference an SVG image in a webpage (such as with the <img> element or as a background image), the SVG image can coordinate with the embedding element (its context) to have the image adopt property values set on the embedding element. To do this the embedding element needs to list the properties that are to be made available to the image by listing them as values of the -moz-context-properties property, and the image needs to opt in to using those properties by using values such as the context-fill value.")property.
