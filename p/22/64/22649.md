## Syntax<a name="Syntax"></a>


The`animation`property is specified as one or more single animations, separated by commas.



Each individual animation is specified as:


* zero or one occurrences of the following values:
	* [`<single-transition-timing-function>`](%28336 "The <single-transition-timing-function> CSS data type denotes a mathematical function that describes how fast one-dimensional values change during animations. This lets you vary the animation's speed over the course of its duration.")
	* [`<single-animation-iteration-count>`](%35912 "")
	* [`<single-animation-direction>`](%35913 "")
	* [`<single-animation-fill-mode>`](%35914 "")
	* [`<single-animation-play-state>`](%35915 "")
* an optional name for the animation, which may be`none`, a[`<custom-ident>`](%28326 "The <custom-ident> CSS data type denotes an arbitrary user-defined string used as an identifier. It is case-sensitive, and certain values are forbidden in various contexts to prevent ambiguity."), or a[`<string>`](%4570 "The <string> CSS data type represents a sequence of characters. Strings are used in numerous CSS properties, such as content, font-family, and quotes.")
* zero, one, or two[`<time>`](%4566 "The <time> CSS data type represents a time value expressed in seconds or milliseconds. It is used in animation, transition, and related properties.")values


The order of values within each animation definition is important: the first value that can be parsed as a[`<time>`](%4566 "The <time> CSS data type represents a time value expressed in seconds or milliseconds. It is used in animation, transition, and related properties.")is assigned to the[`animation-duration`](%22651 "The animation-duration CSS property specifies the length of time that an animation should take to complete one cycle."), and the second one is assigned to[`animation-delay`](%14111 "The animation-delay CSS property specifies when an animation should start. You can begin the animation at a future point in time, immediately and from its begining, or immediately and partway through the animation cycle.").



The order within each animation definition is also important for distinguishing[`animation-name`](%4499 "The animation-name CSS property specifies one or more animations that should be applied to an element. Each name indicates an @keyframes at-rule that defines the property values for the animation sequence.")values from other keywords. When parsed, keywords that are valid for properties other than[`animation-name`](%4499 "The animation-name CSS property specifies one or more animations that should be applied to an element. Each name indicates an @keyframes at-rule that defines the property values for the animation sequence."), and whose values were not found earlier in the shorthand, must be accepted for those properties rather than for[`animation-name`](%4499 "The animation-name CSS property specifies one or more animations that should be applied to an element. Each name indicates an @keyframes at-rule that defines the property values for the animation sequence."). Furthermore, when serialized, default values of other properties must be output in at least the cases necessary to distinguish an[`animation-name`](%4499 "The animation-name CSS property specifies one or more animations that should be applied to an element. Each name indicates an @keyframes at-rule that defines the property values for the animation sequence.")that could be a value of another property, and may be output in additional cases.

## Accessibility concerns<a name="Accessibility_concerns"></a>


Blinking and flashing animation can be problematic for people with cognitive concerns such as Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). Additionally, certain kinds of motion can be a trigger for Vestibular disorders, epilepsy, and migraine and Scotopic sensitivity.



Consider providing a mechanism for pausing or disabling animation, as well as using the Reduced Motion Media Query to create a complimentary experience for users who have expressed a preference for no animated experiences.

### Quantum CSS notes<a name="Quantum_CSS_notes"></a>

* Gecko has a bug whereby when you animate an offscreen element onscreen but specify a delay, Gecko does not repaint on some platforms, e.g. Windows ([bug 1383239](%35921 "FIXED: Viewport doesn't repaint for delayed animation moving an item into view.")). This has been fixed in Firefox&#39;s new parallel CSS engine (also known as[Quantum CSS](%29311 "")or[Stylo](%29312 ""), planned for release in Firefox 57).
* Another Gecko bug means that[`<details>`](%12290 "The HTML Details Element (<details>) is used to create a disclosure widget in which information is visible only when the widget is toggled into an "open" state. A summary or label can be provided using the <summary> element.")elements can&#39;t be made open by default using the`open`attribute if they have an animation active on them ([bug 1382124](%35922 "On gecko details element can't be open if the element has animation but it can on stylo")). Quantum CSS fixes this.
* A further bug means that animations using em units are not affected by changes to the[`font-size`](%33511 "The font-size CSS property specifies the size of the font. Setting this property may change the size of other items, too, since it is used to compute the value of em, ex, and various other relative <length> units.")on the animated element&#39;s parent, whereas they should be ([bug 1254424](%35923 "Animations using em-based units should respond to changes in the font-size on the parent")). Quantum CSS fixes this.
