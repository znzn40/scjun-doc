The**`MediaStreamConstraints`**dictionary is used when calling[`getUserMedia()`](%14533 "The MediaDevices getUserMedia() method prompts the user for permission to use a media input which produces a MediaStream with tracks containing the requested types of media.")to specify what kinds of tracks should be included in the returned[`MediaStream`](%14032 "The MediaStream interface represents a stream of media content. A stream consists of several tracks such as video or audio tracks. Each track is specified as an instance of MediaStreamTrack."), and, optionally, to establish constraints for those tracks&#39; settings.



To learn more about how constraints work, see[Capabilities, constraints, and settings](%5050 "").


## Properties<a name="Properties"></a>


Some combination—but not necessarily all—of the following properties will exist on the object.


### Track constraints<a name="Track_constraints"></a>
<dl><dt>[`video`](%14979 "The MediaStreamConstraints dictionary's video property is used to indicate what kind of video track, if any, should be included in the MediaStream returned by a call to getUserMedia().")</dt><dd>Either a Boolean (which indicates whether or not a video track is requested) or a[`MediaTrackConstraints`](%5051 "The MediaTrackConstraints dictionary is used to describe a set of capabilities and the value or values each can take on. A constraints dictionary is passed into applyConstraints() to allow a script to establish a set of exact (required) values or ranges and/or preferred values or ranges of values for the track, and the most recently-requested set of custom constraints can be retrieved by calling getConstraints().")object providing the constraints which must be met by the video track included in the returned[`MediaStream`](%14032 "The MediaStream interface represents a stream of media content. A stream consists of several tracks such as video or audio tracks. Each track is specified as an instance of MediaStreamTrack."). If constraints are specified, a video track is inherently requested.</dd><dt>[`audio`](%14980 "The MediaStreamConstraints dictionary's audio property is used to indicate what kind of audio track, if any, should be included in the MediaStream returned by a call to getUserMedia().")</dt><dd>Either a Boolean (which indicates whether or not an audio track is requested) or a[`MediaTrackConstraints`](%5051 "The MediaTrackConstraints dictionary is used to describe a set of capabilities and the value or values each can take on.

### Security<a name="Security"></a>

As JavaScript already uses such strings, DOMString is mapped directly to a String.")identifying the peer who has sole access to the stream. If this property is specified, only the indicated peer can receive and use the stream. Streams isolated in this way can only be displayed in a media element ([`<audio>`](%13227 "The HTML <audio> element is used to embed sound content in documents. It may contain one or more audio sources, represented using the src attribute or the <source> element: the browser will choose the most suitable one. It can also be the destination for streamed media, using a MediaStream.")or[`<video>`](%13226 "The HTML Video element (<video>) embeds a media player which supports video playback into the document.")) where the content is protected just as if[CORS](%14982 "CORS: CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) is a system, consisting of transmitting HTTP headers, that determines whether to block or fulfill requests for restricted resources on a web page from another domain outside the domain from which the resource originated.")cross-origin rules were in effect.</dd></dl>
