**Non-standard**<br></br>This feature is non-standard and is not on a standards track. Do not use it on production sites facing the Web: it will not work for every user. There may also be large incompatibilities between implementations and the behavior may change in the future.



## Summary<a name="Summary"></a>


If you&#39;re developing privileged code, and would like to create a worker that can use[js-ctypes](%4846 "en/js-ctypes")to perform calls to native code, you can do so by using`ChromeWorker`instead of the standard[`Worker`](%4847 "The Worker interface of the Web Workers API represents a background task that can be easily created and can send messages back to its creator. Creating a worker is as simple as calling the Worker() constructor and specifying a script to be run in the worker thread.")object. It works exactly like a standard[`Worker`](%4847 "The Worker interface of the Web Workers API represents a background task that can be easily created and can send messages back to its creator. Creating a worker is as simple as calling the Worker() constructor and specifying a script to be run in the worker thread."), except that it has access to[js-ctypes](%4846 "en/js-ctypes")via a global`ctypes`object available in the global scope of the worker. Examples of ChromeWorker&#39;s using js-ctypes are availabe on Github and are linked to from the[See Also section below](%4848 ""). To use a postMessage with callback version of ChromeWorker that features promises, see[PromiseWorker](%4849 "").



Addons must use absolute URLs to load their workers, and those URLs have to be using a`chrome://`or`resource://`protocol (`file://`is not accepted.) Addons that wish to use`file://`URLs must first register a resource replacement path, using code like this:


```
var fileuri = Services.io.newFileURI(file);
Services.io.getProtocolHandler('resource').
              QueryInterface(Ci.nsIResProtocolHandler).
              setSubstitution('my-cool-addon', fileuri);
  var worker = new Worker('resource://my-cool-addon/worker.js');
```
