A CSS**<dfn>pseudo-class</dfn>**is a keyword added to a selector that specifies a special state of the selected element(s). For example,[`:hover`]34496 "The :hover CSS pseudo-class matches when the user interacts with an element with a pointing device, but does not necessarily activate it. It is generally triggered when the user hovers over an element with the cursor (mouse pointer).")can be used to change a button&#39;s color when the user hovers over it.


```
div:hover {
  background-color: #F89B4D;
}
```


Pseudo-classes let you apply a style to an element not only in relation to the content of the document tree, but also in relation to external factors like the history of the navigator ([`:visited`]25905 "The :visited CSS pseudo-class represents links that the user has already visited. For privacy reasons, the styles that can be modified using this selector are very limited."), for example), the status of its content (like[`:checked`]34497 "The :checked CSS pseudo-class selector represents any radio (<input type="radio">), checkbox (<input type="checkbox">), or option (<option> in a <select>) element that is checked or toggled to an on state.")on certain form elements), or the position of the mouse (like[`:hover`]34496 "The :hover CSS pseudo-class matches when the user interacts with an element with a pointing device, but does not necessarily activate it. It is generally triggered when the user hovers over an element with the cursor (mouse pointer)."), which lets you know if the mouse is over an element or not).



**Note:**In contrast to pseudo-classes,[`pseudo-elements`]34498 "A CSS pseudo-element is a keyword added to a selector that lets you style a specific part of the selected element(s). For example, ::first-line can be used to change the font of the first line of a paragraph.")can be used to style a*specific part*of an element.

```
selector:pseudo-class {
  property: value;
}

```


Like regular classes, you can chain together as many pseudo-classes as you want in a selector.
