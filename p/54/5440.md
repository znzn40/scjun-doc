git-upload-pack - Send objects packed back to git-fetch-pack





## [](%5440#_synopsis "")SYNOPSIS<a name="_synopsis"></a>

```
git-upload-pack [--[no-]strict] [--timeout=<n>] [--stateless-rpc]
		  [--advertise-refs] <directory>
DESCRIPTION
-----------
Invoked by git fetch-pack, learns what
objects the other side is missing, and sends them after packing.
```



This command is usually not invoked directly by the end user. The UI for the protocol is on the<em>git fetch-pack</em>side, and the program pair is meant to be used to pull updates from a remote repository. For push operations, see<em>git send-pack</em>.

<dl><dt id='git-upload-pack---no-strict'>[](%5440#git-upload-pack---no-strict "")--[no-]strict</dt><dd>

Do not try &lt;directory&gt;/.git/ if &lt;directory&gt; is no Git directory.

</dd><dt id='git-upload-pack---timeoutltngt'>[](%5440#git-upload-pack---timeoutltngt "")--timeout=&lt;n&gt;</dt><dd>

Interrupt transfer after &lt;n&gt; seconds of inactivity.

</dd><dt id='git-upload-pack---stateless-rpc'>[](%5440#git-upload-pack---stateless-rpc "")--stateless-rpc</dt><dd>

Perform only a single read-write cycle with stdin and stdout. This fits with the HTTP POST request processing model where a program may read the request, write a response, and must exit.

</dd><dt id='git-upload-pack---advertise-refs'>[](%5440#git-upload-pack---advertise-refs "")--advertise-refs</dt><dd>

Only the initial ref advertisement is output, and the program exits immediately. This fits with the HTTP GET request model, where no request content is received but a response must be produced.

</dd><dt id='git-upload-pack-ltdirectorygt'>[](%5440#git-upload-pack-ltdirectorygt "")&lt;directory&gt;</dt><dd>

The repository to sync from.
