The**`repeating-radial-gradient()`**[CSS]427 "")function creates an image consisting of repeating gradients that radiate from an origin. It is similar to[`radial-gradient()`]33478 "The radial-gradient() CSS function creates an image consisting of a progressive transition between two or more colors that radiate from an origin. Its shape may be a circle or an ellipse. The function's result is an object of the <gradient> data type, which is a special kind of <image>.")and takes the same arguments, but it repeats the color stops infinitely in all directions so as to cover its entire container. The function&#39;s result is an object of the[`<gradient>`]28329 "The <gradient> CSS data type is a special type of <image> that consists of a progressive transition between two or more colors.")data type, which is a special kind of[`<image>`]28330 "The <image> CSS data type represents a two-dimensional image. There are two kinds of images: plain images, referenced with a <url>, and dynamically-generated images, generated with <gradient> or element(). Images can be used with numerous CSS properties, such as background-image, border-image, content, cursor, and list-style-image.").

With each repetition, the positions of the color stops are shifted by a multiple of the dimensions of the basic radial gradient (the distance between the last color stop and the first). Thus, the position of each ending color stop coincides with a starting color stop; if the color values are different, this will result in a sharp visual transition.



As with any gradient, a repeating radial gradient has[no intrinsic dimensions]30309 ""); i.e., it has no natural or preferred size, nor a preferred ratio. Its concrete size will match the size of the element it applies to.



Because`<gradient>`s belong to the`<image>`data type, they can only be used where`<image>`s can be used. For this reason,`repeating-radial-gradient()`won&#39;t work on[`background-color`]29451 "The background-color CSS property sets the background color of an element.")and other properties that use the[`<color>`]4569 "The <color> CSS data type represents a color in the sRGB color space. A <color> may also include an alpha-channel transparency value, indicating how the color should composite with its background.")data type.


## Syntax<a name="Syntax"></a>

/* A repeating gradient at the center of its container,
   starting red, changing to blue, and finishing green */
repeating-radial-gradient(circle at center, red 0, blue, green 30px);

If unspecified, it defaults to`center`.</dd><dt id=''>`<shape>`</dt><dd>The gradient&#39;s shape. The value can be`circle`(meaning that the gradient&#39;s shape is a circle with constant radius) or`ellipse`(meaning that the shape is an axis-aligned ellipse). If unspecified, it defaults to`ellipse`.</dd><dt id=''>`<extent-keyword>`</dt><dd>A keyword describing how big the ending shape must be. The possible values are:</dd><dd>
Keyword | Description 
`closest-side` | The gradient&#39;s ending shape meets the side of the box closest to its center (for circles) or meets both the vertical and horizontal sides closest to the center (for ellipses). 
`closest-corner` | The gradient&#39;s ending shape is sized so that it exactly meets the closest corner of the box from its center. 
`farthest-side` | Similar to`closest-side`, except the ending shape is sized to meet the side of the box farthest from its center (or vertical and horizontal sides). 
`farthest-corner` | The gradient&#39;s ending shape is sized so that it exactly meets the farthest corner of the box from its center. 



**Note:**Early implementations of this function included other keywords (`cover`and`contain`) as synonyms of the standard`farthest-corner`and`closest-side`, respectively. Use the standard keywords only, as some implementations have already dropped those older variants.

A percentage of`0%`, or a length of`0`, represents the center of the gradient; the value`100%`represents the intersection of the ending shape with the virtual gradient ray. Percentage values in between are linearly positioned on the gradient ray.</dd></dl>

[1] Before Firefox 36, Gecko didn&#39;t apply gradient on the pre-multiplied color space, leading to shade of grey unexpectedly appearing when used with transparency. Since Firefox 42, the prefixed version of gradients can be disabled by setting`layout.css.prefixes.gradients`to`false`.



In addition to the unprefixed support, Gecko 44.0 (Firefox 44.0 / Thunderbird 44.0 / SeaMonkey 2.41) added support for a`-webkit`prefixed version of the function for web compatibility reasons behind the preference`layout.css.prefixes.webkit`, defaulting to`false`. Since Gecko 49.0 (Firefox 49.0 / Thunderbird 49.0 / SeaMonkey 2.46) the preference defaults to`true`.
