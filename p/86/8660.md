The`**Element.requestFullscreen()**`method issues an asynchronous request to make the element be displayed full-screen.



It&#39;s not guaranteed that the element will be put into full screen mode. If permission to enter full screen mode is granted, the returned[`Promise`](%4237 "The Promise object represents the eventual completion (or failure) of an asynchronous operation, and its resulting value.")will resolve and the document will receive a`[fullscreenchange](%24622 "/en-US/docs/Web/Events/fullscreenchange")`event to let it know that it&#39;s now in full screen mode. If permission is denied, the promise is rejected and the document receives a`[fullscreenerror](%24623 "/en-US/docs/Web/Events/fullscreenerror")`event instead.



This method must be invoked from a user interaction or a device orientation change, else it will fail.



Only elements which are in the HTML namespace (that is, elements which are standard HTML), plus the[`<svg>`](%24624 "The documentation about this has not yet been written; please consider contributing!")and[`<math>`](%24625 "The documentation about this has not yet been written; please consider contributing!")elements, which are located in the top-level document or in an[`<iframe>`](%24626 "The HTML Inline Frame element (<iframe>) represents a nested browsing context, effectively embedding another HTML page into the current page.")with the`[allowfullscreen](%24627 "")`attribute can be displayed full-screen. This means that elements inside a[`<frame>`](%24628 "<frame> is an HTML element which defines a particular area in which another HTML document can be displayed. A frame should be used within a <frameset>.")or an[`<object>`](%12937 "The HTML <object> element represents an external resource, which can be treated as an image, a nested browsing context, or a resource to be handled by a plugin.")can&#39;t.



## Syntax<a name="Syntax"></a>

```
var Promise = Element.requestFullscreen();

```





### Parameters<a name="Parameters"></a>


None.


### Return value<a name="Return_value"></a>


A[`Promise`](%4237 "The Promise object represents the eventual completion (or failure) of an asynchronous operation, and its resulting value.")which is resolved with a value of`undefined`when the transition to full screen is complete.


### Exceptions<a name="Exceptions"></a>


The promise may reject with an exception if the request for full screen fails. Possible exceptions include:






* The element&#39;s document is not in a state where it can go full screen (for instance, it has no`defaultView`).
* The element is not a HTML, SVG or Math element.
* Full screen is not allowed (e.g. not initiated from a user action) or not supported.

## Example<a name="Example"></a>


Before calling`requestFullscreen()`, set up event handlers for the`[fullscreenchange](%24622 "/en-US/docs/Web/Events/fullscreenchange")`and`[fullscreenerror](%24623 "/en-US/docs/Web/Events/fullscreenerror")`events, so you know when you&#39;ve successfully switched into full-screen mode (or when permission to do so has been denied).

[1] Also implemented as`webkitRequestFullscreen`.



[2] Implemented as`mozRequestFullScreen`(notice the capital S for Screen). Before Firefox 44, Gecko incorrectly allowed elements inside a[`<frame>`](%24628 "<frame> is an HTML element which defines a particular area in which another HTML document can be displayed. A frame should be used within a <frameset>.")or an[`<object>`](%12937 "The HTML <object> element represents an external resource, which can be treated as an image, a nested browsing context, or a resource to be handled by a plugin.")to request, and to be granted, fullscreen. In Firefox 44 and onwards this has been fixed: only elements in the top-level document or in an[`<iframe>`](%24626 "The HTML Inline Frame element (<iframe>) represents a nested browsing context, effectively embedding another HTML page into the current page.")with the`[allowfullscreen](%24627 "")`attribute can be displayed fullscreen.
