The`**XMLHttpRequestResponseType**`type is an enumerated set of strings which are used to specify the type of data contained in the[`response`](%21908 "The XMLHttpRequest response property returns the response's body content as an ArrayBuffer, Blob, Document, JavaScript Object, or DOMString, depending on the value of the request's responseType property.")of an[`XMLHttpRequest`](%14224 "Use XMLHttpRequest (XHR) objects to interact with servers. You can retrieve data from a URL without having to do a full page refresh. This enables a Web page to update just part of a page without disrupting what the user is doing.").These values are used when getting or setting the[`responseType`](%21909 "The XMLHttpRequest property responseType is an enumerated string value specifying the type of data contained in the response.")on the request.


## Values<a name="Values"></a>
Value | Description 
 ---  |  ---  | 
`""` | An empty`responseType`string is treated the same as`"text"`, the default type (therefore, as a[`DOMString`](%3945 "DOMString is a UTF-16 String. As JavaScript already uses such strings, DOMString is mapped directly to a String."). 
`"arraybuffer"` | The[`response`](%21908 "The XMLHttpRequest response property returns the response's body content as an ArrayBuffer, Blob, Document, JavaScript Object, or DOMString, depending on the value of the request's responseType property.")is a JavaScript[`ArrayBuffer`](%3603 "The ArrayBuffer object is used to represent a generic, fixed-length raw binary data buffer. You cannot directly manipulate the contents of an ArrayBuffer; instead, you create one of the typed array objects or a DataView object which represents the buffer in a specific format, and use that to read and write the contents of the buffer.")containing binary data. 
`"blob"` | The`response`is a[`Blob`](%4167 "A Blob object represents a file-like object of immutable, raw data. Blobs represent data that isn't necessarily in a JavaScript-native format. The File interface is based on Blob, inheriting blob functionality and expanding it to support files on the user's system.")object containing the binary data. 
`"document"` | The`response`is an[HTML](%138 "HTML: HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is a descriptive language that specifies webpage structure.")[`Document`](%11711 "The Document interface represents any web page loaded in the browser and serves as an entry point into the web page's content, which is the DOM tree.")or[XML](%449 "XML: eXtensible Markup Language (XML) is a generic markup language specified by the W3C. The information technology (IT) industry uses many languages based on XML as data-description languages.")[`XMLDocument`](%21910 "The XMLDocument interface represent an XML document. It inherits from the generic Document and does not add any specific methods or properties to it: nevertheless, several algorithms behave differently with the two types of documents."), as appropriate based on the MIME type of the received data. See[HTML in XMLHttpRequest](%21911 "")to learn more about using XHR to fetch HTML content. 
`"json"` | The`response`is a JavaScript object created by parsing the contents of received data as[JSON](%16796 "JSON: JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) is a data-interchange format.  Although not a strict subset, JSON closely resembles a subset of JavaScript syntax. Though many programming languages support JSON, JSON is especially useful for JavaScript-based apps, including websites and browser extensions."). 
`"text"` | The`response`is text in a[`DOMString`](%3945 "DOMString is a UTF-16 String. As JavaScript already uses such strings, DOMString is mapped directly to a String.")object. 
`"moz-chunked-arraybuffer"`<i></i> | Similar to`"arraybuffer"`, but the data is received in a stream. When using this response type, the value in`response`is only available in the handler for the`[progress](%8871 "/en-US/docs/Web/Events/progress")`event, and only contains the data received since the last`progress`event, rather than the cumulative data received since the request was sent.



Accessing`response`during a`progress`event returns the data received so far. Outside the`progress`event handler, the value of`response`is always`null`. 
`"ms-stream"`<i></i> | The`response`is part of a streaming download; this response type is only allowed for download requests, and is only supported by Internet Explorer.
