Every[HTML]12319 "")element is a member of one or more**content categories**, which group elements that share characteristics.This is a loose grouping (it doesn&#39;t actually create a relationship among elements of these categories), but they help define and describe the categories&#39; shared behavior and their associated rules, especially when you come upon their intricate details. It&#39;s also possible for elements to not be a member of*any*of these categories.



There are three types of content categories:


* Main content categories, which describe common rules shared by many elements.
* Form-related content categories, which describe rules common to form-related elements.
* Specific content categories, which describe rare categories shared only by a few elements, sometimes only in a specific context.


**Note:**A more detailed discussion of these content categories and their comparative functionalities is beyond the scope of this article; for that, you may wish to read the[relevant portions of the HTML specification]40377 "").







## Main content categories<a name="Main_content_categories"></a>

### Metadata content<a name="Metadata_content"></a>


Elements belonging to the*metadata content*category modify the presentation or the behavior of the rest of the document, set up links to other documents, or convey other*out of band*information.

### Sectioning content<a name="Sectioning_content"></a>


Elements belonging to the sectioning content model create a[section in the current outline]32709 "Sections and Outlines of an HTML5 document")that defines the scope of[`<header>`]39416 "The HTML <header> element represents introductory content, typically a group of introductory or navigational aids.

Elements belonging to this category are[`<article>`]36799 "The HTML <article> element represents a self-contained composition in a document, page, application, or site, which is intended to be independently distributable or reusable (e.g., in syndication).

Common examples of navigation sections are menus, tables of contents, and indexes.")and[`<section>`]36280 "The HTML <section> element represents a standalone section — which doesn't have a more specific semantic element to represent it — contained within an HTML document.").



Do not confuse this content model with the[sectioning root]39173 "Sections and Outlines of an HTML5 document#sectioning root")category, which isolates its content from the regular outline.



### Heading content<a name="Heading_content"></a>


Heading content defines the title of a section, whether marked by an explicit[sectioning content]40382 "")element, or implicitly defined by the heading content itself.



Elements belonging to this category are[`<h1>`]12534 "Heading elements implement six levels of document headings, <h1> is the most important and <h6> is the least.

Though likely to contain heading content, the[`<header>`]39416 "The HTML <header> element represents introductory content, typically a group of introductory or navigational aids. It may contain some heading elements but also other elements like a logo, a search form, an author name, and so on.")is not heading content itself.




**Note:**The[`<hgroup>`]39417 "The HTML <hgroup> element represents a multi-level heading for a section of a document. It groups a set of <h1>–<h6> elements.")element was removed from the W3C HTML specification prior to HTML 5 being finalized, but is still part of the WHATWG specification and is at least partially supported by most browsers.



### Phrasing content<a name="Phrasing_content"></a>


Phrasing content defines the text and the mark-up it contains. Runs of phrasing content make up paragraphs.

A few other elements belong to this category, but only if a specific condition is fulfilled:

### Palpable content<a name="Palpable_content"></a>


Content is palpable when it&#39;s neither empty or hidden; it is content that is rendered and is substantive. Elements whose model is flow content or phrasing content should have at least one node which is palpable.


### Form-associated content<a name="Form-associated_content"></a>


Form-associated content comprises elements that have a form owner, exposed by a**form**attribute. A form owner is either the containing[`<form>`]12729 "The HTML <form> element represents a document section that contains interactive controls to submit information to a web server.")element or the element whose id is specified in the**form**attribute.

## Secondary categories<a name="Secondary_categories"></a>


There are some secondary classifications of elements that can be useful to be aware of as well.


### Script-supporting elements<a name="Script-supporting_elements"></a>


**Script-supporting elements**are elements which don&#39;t directly contribute to the rendered output of a document. Instead, they serve to support scripts, either by containing or specifying script code directly, or by specifying data that will be used by scripts.



The script-supporting elements are:


* [`<script>`]39431 "The HTML <script> element is used to embed or reference executable code; this is typically used to embed or refer to JavaScript code.")
* [`<template>`]39436 "The HTML <template> element is a mechanism for holding client-side content that is not to be rendered when a page is loaded but may subsequently be instantiated during runtime using JavaScript.")

## Transparent content model<a name="Transparent_content_model"></a>


If an element has a transparent content model, then its contents must be structured such that they would be valid HTML 5, even if the transparent element were removed and replaced by the child elements.



For example, the[`<del>`]12904 "The HTML <del> element represents a range of text that has been deleted from a document.")and[`<ins>`]12905 "The HTML <ins> element represents a range of text that has been added to a document.")elements are transparent:


```
<p>We hold these truths to be <del><em>sacred &amp; undeniable</em></del> <ins>self-evident</ins>.</p>
```


If those elements were removed, this fragment would still be valid HTML (if not correct English).


```
<p>We hold these truths to be <em>sacred &amp; undeniable</em> self-evident.</p>
```

## Other content models<a name="Other_content_models"></a>
