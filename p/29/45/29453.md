The**`linear-gradient()`**[CSS]427 "")function creates an image consisting of a progressive transition between two or more colors along a straight line. Its result is an object of the[`<gradient>`]28329 "The <gradient> CSS data type is a special type of <image> that consists of a progressive transition between two or more colors.")data type, which is a special kind of[`<image>`]28330 "The <image> CSS data type represents a two-dimensional image. There are two kinds of images: plain images, referenced with a <url>, and dynamically-generated images, generated with <gradient> or element(). Images can be used with numerous CSS properties, such as background-image, border-image, content, cursor, and list-style-image.").

As with any gradient, a linear gradient has[no intrinsic dimensions]30309 ""); i.e., it has no natural or preferred size, nor a preferred ratio. Its concrete size will match the size of the element it applies to.



To create a linear gradient that repeats so as to fill its container, use the[`repeating-linear-gradient()`]33479 "The repeating-linear-gradient() CSS function creates an image consisting of repeating linear gradients. It is similar to linear-gradient() and takes the same arguments, but it repeats the color stops infinitely in all directions so as to cover its entire container. The function's result is an object of the <gradient> data type, which is a special kind of <image>.")function instead.



Because`<gradient>`s belong to the`<image>`data type, they can only be used where`<image>`s can be used. For this reason,`linear-gradient()`won&#39;t work on[`background-color`]29451 "The background-color CSS property sets the background color of an element.")and other properties that use the[`<color>`]4569 "The <color> CSS data type represents a color in the sRGB color space. A <color> may also include an alpha-channel transparency value, indicating how the color should composite with its background.")data type.


## Composition of a linear gradient<a name="Composition_of_a_linear_gradient"></a>


A linear gradient is defined by an axis—the*gradient line*—and two or more*color-stop points*. Each point on the axis is a distinct color; to create a smooth gradient, the`linear-gradient()`function draws a series of colored lines perpendicular to the gradient line, each one matching the color of the point where it intersects the gradient line.



![linear-gradient.png]30761 "")



The gradient line is defined by the center of the box containing the gradient image and by an angle. The colors of the gradient are determined by two or more points: the starting point, the ending point, and, in between, optional color-stop points.



The*starting point*is the location on the gradient line where the first color begins. The*ending point*is the point where the last color ends. Each of these two points is defined by the intersection of the gradient line with a perpendicular line passing from the box corner which is in the same quadrant. The ending point can be simply understood as the symmetrical point of the starting point. These somewhat complex definitions lead to an interesting effect sometimes called*magic corners*: the corners nearest to the starting and ending points have the same color as their respective starting or ending points.



By adding more color-stop points on the gradient line, you can create a highly customized transition between the starting and ending colors. A color-stop&#39;s position can be explicitly defined by using a[`<length>`]4561 "The <length> CSS data type represents a distance value. Lengths can be used in numerous CSS properties, such as width, height, margin, padding, border-width, font-size, and text-shadow.")or a[`<percentage>`]4567 "The <percentage> CSS data type represents a percentage value. It is often used to define a size as relative to an element's parent object. Numerous properties can use percentages, such as width, height, margin, padding, and font-size."). If you don&#39;t specify the location, it is placed halfway between the one that precedes it and the one that follows it.

[1] Gecko, Opera &amp; Webkit consider[`<angle>`]4563 "The <angle> CSS data type represents an angle value expressed in degrees, gradians, radians, or turns. It is used, for example, in <gradient>s and in some transform functions.")to start to the right, instead of the top. I.e. it considered an angle of`0deg`as a direction indicator pointing to the right. This is different from the latest specification where an angle of`0deg`as a direction indicator points to the top. Since Firefox 42, the prefixed version of gradients can be disabled by setting`layout.css.prefixes.gradients`to`false`.



[2] Before Gecko 36.0 (Firefox 36.0 / Thunderbird 36.0 / SeaMonkey 2.33), Gecko didn&#39;t apply gradients on the pre-multiplied color space, leading to shades of grey unexpectedly appearing when used with transparency.



[3] WebKit since 528 supports the legacy[`-webkit-gradient(linear,…)`function]30771 ""). As of WebKit 534.16, it also supports the standard gradient syntax. Unlike in Gecko, in legacy WebKit you cannot specify both a position and an angle in`-webkit-linear-gradient()`. You can achieve the same effect by offsetting the color stops.



[4] Internet Explorer 5.5 through 9.0 supports proprietary[`filter: progid:DXImageTransform.Microsoft.Gradient()`filter]30772 "").



[5] Firefox 3.6 and Opera 11.10 implemented, prefixed, an early syntax where the starting corner or side was indicated without the`to`keyword, and effectively considered as a &#39;from&#39; position. The`to`syntax has been added in Firefox 10 and Opera 11.60.



In addition to the unprefixed support using the standard syntax, Gecko 44.0 (Firefox 44.0 / Thunderbird 44.0 / SeaMonkey 2.41) added support for a`-webkit`prefixed version of the function using the legacy &#39;from&#39; syntax for web compatibility reasons behind the preference`layout.css.prefixes.webkit`, defaulting to`false`. Since Gecko 49.0 (Firefox 49.0 / Thunderbird 49.0 / SeaMonkey 2.46) the preference defaults to`true`.



[6] Opera &amp; Webkit consider[`<angle>`]4563 "The <angle> CSS data type represents an angle value expressed in degrees, gradians, radians, or turns. It is used, for example, in <gradient>s and in some transform functions.")to start to the right, instead of the top. I.e. it considered an angle of`0deg`as a direction indicator pointing to the right. This is different from the latest specification where an angle of`0deg`as a direction indicator points to the top. Since Firefox 42, the prefixed version of gradients can be disabled by setting`layout.css.prefixes.gradients`to`false`. WebKit since 528 supports the legacy[`-webkit-gradient(linear,…)`function]30771 ""). As of WebKit 534.16, it also supports the standard gradient syntax. Unlike in Gecko, in legacy WebKit you cannot specify both a position and an angle in`-webkit-linear-gradient()`. You can achieve the same effect by offsetting the color stops.



[7] To match webkit/blink behavior, unitless 0 for angles are accepted, in`-webkit-linear-gradient`function since Gecko 46.0 (Firefox 46.0 / Thunderbird 46.0 / SeaMonkey 2.43) (see[bug 1239153]30773 "FIXED: Firefox's CSS parser rejects "-webkit-linear-gradient(0,pink,teal)"")), and in`linear-gradient`function since Gecko 55.0 (Firefox 55.0 / Thunderbird 55.0 / SeaMonkey 2.52) (see[bug 1363292]31773 "FIXED: Zero (0) angle value without degree unit is not correctly interpreted in linear-gradient")).
