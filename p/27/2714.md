**This is an[experimental technology](%3404 "")**<br></br>Check the[Browser compatibility table](%11259 "")carefully before using this in production.




**Non-standard**<br></br>This feature is non-standard and is not on a standards track. Do not use it on production sites facing the Web: it will not work for every user. There may also be large incompatibilities between implementations and the behavior may change in the future.




The**`FileSystemFlags`**dictionary defines a set of values which are used when specifying option flags when calling certain methods in the[File and Directory Entries API](%6832 ""). Methods which accept an options parameter of this type may specify zero or more of these flags as fields in an object, like this:


```
dataDirectoryEntry.getDirectory("Workspace", { create: true }, function(entry) {
});
```


Here, we see that the`create`property is provided, with a value of`true`, indicating that the directory should be created if it&#39;s not already there.



Note that these option flags currently don&#39;t have any useful meaning when used in the scope of Web content, where security precautions prevent the creation of new files or the replacement of existing ones.

### Values and results<a name="Values_and_results"></a>


The table below describes the result of each possible combination of these flags depending on whether or not the target file or directory path already exists.

Option values | File/directory condition | Result 
[`create`](%11262 "The create property on the FileSystemFlags dictionary is used to indicate whether or not the file should be created if it's missing. FileSystemFlags is only used when calling FileSystemDirectoryEntry.getFile() or FileSystemDirectoryEntry.getDirectory().") | [`exclusive`](%11264 "The exclusive property on the FileSystemFlags dictionary is used in tandem with the create property to determine whether or not it's acceptable to require that the file not already exist when the reference to it is created by calling FileSystemDirectoryEntry.getFile() or FileSystemDirectoryEntry.getDirectory().")
