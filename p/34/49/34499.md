The**`:active`**[CSS]427 "")[pseudo-class]28374 "Pseudo-classes")represents an element (such as a button) that is being activated by the user.When using a mouse, &quot;activation&quot; typically starts when the user presses down the primary mouse button.


```
/* Selects any <a> that is being activated */
a:active {
  color: red;
}
```


The`:active`pseudo-class is commonly used on[`<a>`]24205 "The HTML <a> element (or anchor element) creates a hyperlink to other web pages, files, locations within the same page, email addresses, or any other URL.")and[`<button>`]23957 "The HTML <button> element represents a clickable button, which can be used in forms, or anywhere in a document that needs simple, standard button functionality.")elements. Other common targets of this pseudo-class include elements that*contain*an activated element, and form elements that are being activated through their associated[`<label>`]12888 "The HTML <label> element represents a caption for an item in a user interface.").



Styles defined by the`:active`pseudo-class will be overridden by any subsequent link-related pseudo-class ([`:link`]34516 "The :link CSS pseudo-class represents an element that has not yet been visited. It matches every unvisited <a>, <area>, or <link> element that has an href attribute."),[`:hover`]34496 "The :hover CSS pseudo-class matches when the user interacts with an element with a pointing device, but does not necessarily activate it. It is generally triggered when the user hovers over an element with the cursor (mouse pointer)."), or[`:visited`]25905 "The :visited CSS pseudo-class represents links that the user has already visited. For privacy reasons, the styles that can be modified using this selector are very limited.")) that has at least equal specificity. To style links appropriately, put the`:active`rule after all other link-related rules, as defined by the*LVHA-order*:`:link`—`:visited`—`:hover`—`:active`.

**Note:**On systems with multi-button mice, CSS3 specifies that the`:active`pseudo-class must only apply to the primary button; on right-handed mice, this is typically the leftmost button.
