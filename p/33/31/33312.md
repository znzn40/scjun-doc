**Non-standard**<br></br>This feature is non-standard and is not on a standards track. Do not use it on production sites facing the Web: it will not work for every user. There may also be large incompatibilities between implementations and the behavior may change in the future.





The**`:-webkit-autofill`**CSS[pseudo-class]29702 "")matches when an[`<input>`]17158 "The HTML <input> element is used to create interactive controls for web-based forms in order to accept data from the user.")element has its value autofilled by the browser.



**Note:**The user agent style sheets of many browsers use`!important`in their`:-webkit-autofill`style declarations, making them non-overrideable by webpages without resorting to JavaScript hacks.
