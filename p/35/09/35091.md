The[Box Alignment]30663 "")specification details how alignment works in various layout methods. On this page we explore how box alignment works in the context of[CSS Grid Layout]29934 "").



As this page aims to detail things which are specific to CSS Grid Layout and Box Alignment, it should be read in conjunction with the main[Box Alignment]30663 "")page which details the common features of box alignment across layout methods.


## Basic Example<a name="Basic_Example"></a>


In this example using grid layout, there is extra space in the grid container after laying out the fixed width tracks on the inline (main) axis. This space is distributed using`justify-content`. On the block (cross) axis the alignment of the items inside their grid areas is controlled with`align-items`. The first item overrides the`align-items`value set on the group by setting`align-self`to`center`.

## Grid axes<a name="Grid_axes"></a>


As a two-dimensional layout method, when working with grid layout we always have two axes on which to align our items. We have access to all of the box alignment properties to help us achieve this.



The inline axis is the axis that corresponds to the direction that words in a sentence would run in the writing mode used. Therefore, in a horizontal language such as English or Arabic the inline direction runs horizontally. Should you be in a vertical writing mode the inline axis will run vertically.

To align things on the inline axis you use the properties that start with`justify-`,[`justify-content`]30349 "The CSS justify-content property defines how the browser distributes space between and around content items along the main axis of their container."),[`justify-items`]30659 "The CSS justify-items property defines the default justify-self for all items of the box, giving them all a default way of justifying each box along the appropriate axis.")and[`justify-self`]30660 "The CSS justify-self property defines the way of justifying a box inside its container along the appropriate axis.").



The block axis crosses the inline axis in the direction that blocks are displayed down the page â€” for example paragraphs in English are displayed one below the other vertically. This, therefore is the block dimension.



To align things on the block axis you use the properties that start with`align-`,[`align-content`]30348 "The CSS align-content property defines how the browser distributes space between and around content items along the cross-axis of their container, which is serving as a flexbox container."),[`align-items`]34906 "The CSS align-items property defines how the browser distributes space between and around flex items along the cross-axis of their container. This means it works like justify-content but in the perpendicular direction.")and[`align-self`]35072 "The align-self CSS property aligns flex items of the current flex line overriding the align-items value. If any of the item's cross-axis margin is set to auto, then align-self is ignored.").

## Self alignment<a name="Self_alignment"></a>

* [`justify-self`]30660 "The CSS justify-self property defines the way of justifying a box inside its container along the appropriate axis.")
* [`align-self`]35072 "The align-self CSS property aligns flex items of the current flex line overriding the align-items value. If any of the item's cross-axis margin is set to auto, then align-self is ignored.")
* [`place-self`]33923 "The place-self CSS property shorthand property sets both the align-self and justify-self properties. The first value is the align-self property value, the second the justify-self one. If the second value is not present, the first value is also used for it.")
* [`justify-items`]30659 "The CSS justify-items property defines the default justify-self for all items of the box, giving them all a default way of justifying each box along the appropriate axis.")
* [`align-items`]34906 "The CSS align-items property defines how the browser distributes space between and around flex items along the cross-axis of their container. This means it works like justify-content but in the perpendicular direction.")
* [`place-items`]33922 "The CSS place-items shorthand property sets both the align-items and justify-items properties. The first value is the align-items property value, the second the justify-items one. If the second value is not present, the first value is also used for it.")


These properties deal with aligning the item inside the grid area it is placed into. The properties`align-items`and`justify-items`are applied to the grid container and set the`align-self`and`justify-self`properties as a group. This means that you can set alignment for all of your grid Items at once, then override any items that need a different alignment by applying the`align-self`or`justify-self`property to the rules for the individual grid Items.



The initial value for`align-self`and`justify-self`is`stretch`so the item will stretch over the entire grid area. The exception to this rule is where the item has an intrinsic aspect ratio, for example an image. In this case the item will be aligned to`start`in both dimensions in order that the image is not distorted.


## Content alignment<a name="Content_alignment"></a>

* [`justify-content`]30349 "The CSS justify-content property defines how the browser distributes space between and around content items along the main axis of their container.")
* [`align-content`]30348 "The CSS align-content property defines how the browser distributes space between and around content items along the cross-axis of their container, which is serving as a flexbox container.")
* [`place-content`]31619 "The place-content CSS shorthand property sets both the align-content and justify-content properties.")


These properties deal with aligning the tracks of the grid when there is extra space to distribute. This scenario will occur if the tracks that you have defined total less than the total width of the grid container.


## Gap and legacy grid-gap properties<a name="Gap_and_legacy_grid-gap_properties"></a>

* [`row-gap`]30302 "The row-gap CSS property sets the size of the gap (gutter) between an element's rows.")
* [`column-gap`]30303 "The column-gap CSS property sets the size of the gap (gutter) between an element's columns.")
* [`gap`]30300 "The gap CSS property specifies the gaps (gutters) between rows and columns. It is a shorthand for row-gap and column-gap.")
* [`grid-row-gap`]31880 "The row-gap CSS property specifies the gutter between rows.")
* [`grid-column-gap`]34914 "The column-gap CSS property sets the size of the gap (gutter) between an element's columns.")
* [`grid-gap`]30304 "The gap CSS property is a shorthand property for row-gap and column-gap specifying the gutters between rows and columns.")


The Grid specification originally contained the definition for the properties[`grid-row-gap`]31880 "The row-gap CSS property specifies the gutter between rows."),[`grid-column-gap`]34914 "The column-gap CSS property sets the size of the gap (gutter) between an element's columns.")and[`grid-gap`]30304 "The gap CSS property is a shorthand property for row-gap and column-gap specifying the gutters between rows and columns."). These have since been moved into the Box Alignment specification and renamed to[`row-gap`]30302 "The row-gap CSS property sets the size of the gap (gutter) between an element's rows."),[`column-gap`]30303 "The column-gap CSS property sets the size of the gap (gutter) between an element's columns."), and[`gap`]30300 "The gap CSS property specifies the gaps (gutters) between rows and columns. It is a shorthand for row-gap and column-gap."). This allows them to be used for other layout methods where a gap between items makes sense.



At present only Microsoft Edge supports the unprefixed properties, therefore to use the gap properties in grid layout you should use the`grid-row-gap`,`grid-column-gap`and`grid-gap`versions to ensure full compatibility. You could double up the properties and use both as you would for vendor prefixes.
