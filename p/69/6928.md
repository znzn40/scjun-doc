Creating a worker is as simple as calling the Worker() constructor and specifying a script to be run in the worker thread.")— i.e. when a message is sent to the worker using the[`Worker.postMessage`](%24329 "The postMessage() method of the Worker interface sends a message to the worker's inner scope. This accepts a single parameter, which is the data to send to the worker. The data may be any value or JavaScript object handled by the structured clone algorithm, which includes cyclical references.")method.


## Syntax<a name="Syntax"></a>

```
self.onmessage = function() { ... };
```

## Example<a name="Example"></a>


The following code snippet shows creation of a[`Worker`](%4847 "The Worker interface of the Web Workers API represents a background task that can be easily created and can send messages back to its creator. Creating a worker is as simple as calling the Worker() constructor and specifying a script to be run in the worker thread.")object using the[`Worker()`](%24330 "The Worker() constructor creates a Worker object that executes the script at the specified URL. This script must obey the same-origin policy.")constructor. Messages are passed to the worker when the value inside the form input`first`changes. A[`Worker.onmessage`](%24331 "The onmessage property of the Worker interface represents an EventHandler, that is a function to be called when the message event occurs. These events are of type MessageEvent and will be called when the worker's parent receives a message (i.e. from the DedicatedWorkerGlobalScope.postMessage method.")handler is also present, to deal with messages are passed back from the worker.


```
var myWorker = new Worker("worker.js");

first.onchange = function() {
  myWorker.postMessage([first.value,second.value]);
  console.log('Message posted to worker');
}

myWorker.onmessage = function(e) {
  result.textContent = e.data;
  console.log('Message received from worker');
}
```


In the`worker.js`script, a`DedicatedWorkerGlobalScope.onmessage`handler is used to handle messages from the main script:


```
onmessage = function(e) {
  console.log('Message received from main script');
  var workerResult = 'Result: ' + (e.data[0] * e.data[1]);
  console.log('Posting message back to main script');
  postMessage(workerResult);
}
```


Notice how in the main script,`onmessage`has to be called on`myWorker`, whereas inside the worker script you just need`onmessage`because the worker is effectively the global scope (the[`DedicatedWorkerGlobalScope`](%24307 "The DedicatedWorkerGlobalScope object (the Worker global scope) is accessible through the self keyword. Some additional global functions, namespaces objects, and constructors, not typically associated with the worker global scope, but available on it, are listed in the JavaScript Reference. See also: Functions available to workers."), in this case).
