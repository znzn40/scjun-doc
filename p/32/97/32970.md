**Non-standard**<br></br>This feature is non-standard and is not on a standards track. Do not use it on production sites facing the Web: it will not work for every user. There may also be large incompatibilities between implementations and the behavior may change in the future.





In Mozilla applications,**`-moz-user-input`**determines if an element will accept user input.


```
/* Keyword values */
-moz-user-input: none;
-moz-user-input: enabled;
-moz-user-input: disabled;

/* Global values */
-moz-user-input: inherit;
-moz-user-input: initial;
-moz-user-input: unset;
```


For elements that normally take user input, such as a[`<textarea>`](%25792 "The HTML <textarea> element represents a multi-line plain-text editing control."), the initial value of`-moz-user-input`is`enabled`.



**Note:**`-moz-user-input`was one of the proposals leading to the proposed CSS 3[`user-input`](%36490 "The documentation about this has not yet been written; please consider contributing!")property, which has not yet reached Candidate Recommendation (call for implementations). A similar property,`user-focus`, was proposed in[early drafts of a predecessor of the CSS3 UI specification](%36486 ""), but was rejected by the working group.



[Initial value](%28552 "") | `auto` 
Applies to | all elements 
[Inherited](%28555 "") | yes 
Media | visual 
[Computed value](%28556 "") | as specified 
Animation type | discrete 
Canonical order | the unique non-ambiguous order defined by the formal grammar

<dl><dt id=''>none</dt><dd>The element does not respond to user input, and it does not become[`:active`](%34499 "The :active CSS pseudo-class represents an element (such as a button) that is being activated by the user.").</dd><dt id=''>enabled</dt><dd>The element accepts user input. For textboxes, this is the default behavior.**Please note that this value is no longer supported in Firefox 60 onwards ([bug 1405087](%36491 "FIXED: JavaScript:  The "click ()" event isn`t executing from the script after deleting/setting to "false" the "disabled" prop of the element "input type = submit"")).**</dd><dt id=''>disabled</dt><dd>The element does not accept user input. However, this is not the same as setting`[disabled](%36492 "")`to true, in that the element is drawn normally.**Please note that this value is no longer supported in Firefox 60 onwards ([bug 1405087](%36491 "FIXED: JavaScript:  The "click ()" event isn`t executing from the script after deleting/setting to "false" the "disabled" prop of the element "input type = submit"")).**</dd></dl>
