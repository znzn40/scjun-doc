An instance of the WebRTC API&#39;s[`RTCRtpEncodingParameters`](%16998 "An instance of the WebRTC API's RTCRtpEncodingParameters dictionary describes a single configuration of a codec.")dictionary describes a single configuration of a[codec](%16961 "codec: A codec  (a blend word derived from "coder-decoder") is a program, algorithm, or device that encodes or decodes a data stream. A given codec knows how to handle a specific encoding or compression technology.").It&#39;s used in the[`RTCRtpParameters`](%16999 "The documentation about this has not yet been written; please consider contributing!")describing the configuration of an RTP[sender](%16711 "")or[receiver](%16973 "").

<dl><dt>[`active`](%17000 "The documentation about this has not yet been written; please consider contributing!")</dt><dd>If`true`, the described encoding is currently actively being used. That is, for RTP senders, the encoding is currently being used to send data, while for receivers, the encoding is being used to decode received data.</dd><dt>[`codecPayloadType`](%17001 "The documentation about this has not yet been written; please consider contributing!")</dt><dd>When describing a codec for an[`RTCRtpSender`](%16711 "The RTCRtpSender interface provides the ability to control and obtain details about how a particular MediaStreamTrack is encoded and sent to a remote peer."),`codecPayloadType`is a single 8-bit byte (or octet) specifying the codec to use for sending the stream.</dd><dt>[`dtx`](%17002 "The documentation about this has not yet been written; please consider contributing!")</dt><dd>Only used for`RTCRtpSender`, this property indicates whether or not to use discontinuous transmission (a feature by which a phone is turned off or the microphone muted automatically in the absence of voice activity). Defaults to`true`.</dd><dt>[`maxBitrate`](%17003 "The documentation about this has not yet been written; please consider contributing!")</dt><dd>An unsigned long integer indicating the maximum number of bits per second to allow for this encoding. Other parameters may further constrain the bit rate, such as the value of`maxFramerate`or transport or physical network limitations.</dd><dt>[`maxFramerate`](%17004 "The documentation about this has not yet been written; please consider contributing!")</dt><dd>A double-precision floating-point value specifying the maximum number of frames per second to allow for this encoding.</dd><dt>[`priority`](%17005 "The documentation about this has not yet been written; please consider contributing!")</dt><dd>A string from the[`RTCPriorityType`](%17006 "The documentation about this has not yet been written; please consider contributing!")enumerated type which indicates the encoding&#39;s priority. Default value is`"low"`.</dd><dt>[`ptime`](%17007 "The documentation about this has not yet been written; please consider contributing!")</dt><dd>An unsigned long integer value which, for`RTCRtpSender`, indicates the preferred duraction of a media packet in milliseconds. This is typically only relevant for audio encodings. The user agent will try to match this as well as it can.</dd><dt>[`rid`](%17008 "The documentation about this has not yet been written; please consider contributing!")</dt><dd>A[`DOMString`](%3945 "DOMString is a UTF-16 String. As JavaScript already uses such strings, DOMString is mapped directly to a String.")which, if set, specifies an**RTP stream ID**(**RID**) to be sent using the RID header extension. This parameter cannot be modified using[`setParameters()`](%17009 "The documentation about this has not yet been written; please consider contributing!"). Its value can only be set when the transceiver is first created.</dd><dt>[`scaleResolutionDownBy`](%17010 "The documentation about this has not yet been written; please consider contributing!")</dt><dd>Only used for senders whose track&#39;s[`kind`](%17011 "The read-only property MediaStreamTrack.kind returns a DOMString set to "audio" if the track is an audio track and to "video", if it is a video track. It doesn't change if the track is deassociated from its source.")is`"video"`, this is a double-precision floating-point value specifying a scaling factor to apply while encoding the video. The default value, 1.0, means that the sent video&#39;s size will be the same as the original. A value of 2.0 scales the video frames down by a factor of 2 in each dimension, resulting in a video 1/4 the size of the original. The value must not be less than 1.0.</dd></dl>
