这篇翻译不完整。请帮忙从英语[翻译这篇文章](%30598 "")。






`**initial**`是将属性的初始值([initial value](%28552 ""))赋给元素 . initial 适用于所有的css 属性(属性的initial值可在[属性表](%30599 "")中查到)，包括css 简写属性(全局属性)[`all`](%27798 "CSS all简写属性重设除了unicode-bidi 和 direction 之外的所有属性至它们的初始值或继承值。").



**Note:**On[inherited properties](%30600 ""), the initial value may be unexpected. You should consider using the[`inherit`](%28010 "此页面仍未被本地化, 期待您的翻译!"),[`unset`](%28244 "The unset CSS keyword is the combination of the initial and inherit keywords. Like these two other CSS-wide keywords, it can be applied to any CSS property, including the CSS shorthand all. This keyword resets the property to its inherited value if it inherits from its parent or to its initial value if not. In other words, it behaves like the inherit keyword in the first case and like the initial keyword in the second case."), or[`revert`](%28153 "此页面仍未被本地化, 期待您的翻译!")keywords instead.

[1] From Firefox 1.0 onward, increasing support for`-moz-initial`was added in each version, culminating with the support for[`quotes`](%28138 "此页面仍未被本地化, 期待您的翻译!")in Firefox 3.5 (Gecko 1.9.1). The last addition was support for the non-standard[`-moz-border-*-colors`](%28954 "此页面仍未被本地化, 期待您的翻译!")in Firefox 3.6 (Gecko 1.9.2). Support for the prefixed`-moz-initial`keyword has been removed as of[Firefox 24](%30603 "")in favor of the unprefixed`initial`keyword.
