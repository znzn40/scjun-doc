**This is an[experimental technology](%3404 "")**<br></br>Check the[Browser compatibility table](%23526 "")carefully before using this in production.




The**`put()`**method of the[`Cache`](%14305 "The Cache interface provides a storage mechanism for Request / Response object pairs that are cached, for example as part of the ServiceWorker life cycle. Note that the Cache interface is exposed to windowed scopes as well as workers.

Note that the Cache interface is exposed to windowed scopes as well as workers.

Often, you will just want to[`fetch()`](%23527 "The documentation about this has not yet been written; please consider contributing!")one or more requests, then add the result straight to your cache. In such cases you are better off using[`Cache.add()`](%14306 "The add() method of the Cache interface takes a URL, retrieves it, and adds the resulting response object to the given cache. ")/[`Cache.addAll()`](%14307 "The addAll() method of the Cache interface takes an array of URLs, retrieves them, and adds the resulting response objects to the given cache. The request objects created during retrieval become keys to the stored response operations. "), as they are shorthand functions for one or more of these operations.


```
fetch(url).then(function(response) {
  if (!response.ok) {
    throw new TypeError('Bad response status');
  }
  return cache.put(url, response);
})
```


**Note**:`put()`will overwrite any key/value pair previously stored in the cache that matches the request.




**Note**:[`Cache.add`](%14306 "The add() method of the Cache interface takes a URL, retrieves it, and adds the resulting response object to the given cache. ")/[`Cache.addAll`](%14307 "The addAll() method of the Cache interface takes an array of URLs, retrieves them, and adds the resulting response objects to the given cache. The request objects created during retrieval become keys to the stored response operations. ")do not cache responses with`Response.status`values that are not in the 200 range, whereas[`Cache.put`](%14312 "The put() method of the Cache interface allows key/value pairs to be added to the current Cache object.")lets you store any request/response pair. As a result,[`Cache.add`](%14306 "The add() method of the Cache interface takes a URL, retrieves it, and adds the resulting response object to the given cache. ")/[`Cache.addAll`](%14307 "The addAll() method of the Cache interface takes an array of URLs, retrieves them, and adds the resulting response objects to the given cache. The request objects created during retrieval become keys to the stored response operations. ")can&#39;t be used to store opaque responses, whereas[`Cache.put`](%14312 "The put() method of the Cache interface allows key/value pairs to be added to the current Cache object.")can.




**Note**: Initial Cache implementations (in both Blink and Gecko) resolve[`Cache.add`](%14306 "The add() method of the Cache interface takes a URL, retrieves it, and adds the resulting response object to the given cache. "),[`Cache.addAll`](%14307 "The addAll() method of the Cache interface takes an array of URLs, retrieves them, and adds the resulting response objects to the given cache. The request objects created during retrieval become keys to the stored response operations. "), and[`Cache.put`](%14312 "The put() method of the Cache interface allows key/value pairs to be added to the current Cache object.")promises when the response body is fully written to the disk. More recent spec versions state that the browser can resolve the promise as soon as the entry is recorded in the database even if the response body is still streaming in.



## Syntax<a name="Syntax"></a>

```
cache.put(request, response).then(function() {
  // request/response pair has been added to the cache
});

```

<dl><dt id=''>request</dt><dd>The[`Request`](%14318 "The Request interface of the Fetch API represents a resource request.")you want to add to the cache.</dd><dt id=''>response</dt><dd>The[`Response`](%14255 "The Response interface of the Fetch API represents the response to a request.")you want to match up to the request.</dd></dl>
### Return value<a name="Return_value"></a>


A[`Promise`](%4237 "The Promise object represents the eventual completion (or failure) of an asynchronous operation, and its resulting value.")that resolves with void.



**Note**: The promise will reject with a`TypeError`if the URL scheme is not`http`or`https`.



## Examples<a name="Examples"></a>


This example is from the MDN[sw-test example](%4722 "")(see[sw-test running live](%4723 "")). Here we wait for a[`FetchEvent`](%14342 "This is the event type for fetch events dispatched on the service worker global scope. It contains information about the fetch, including the request and how the receiver will treat the response. It provides the event.respondWith() method, which allows us to provide a response to this fetch.")to fire. We construct a custom response like so:


1. Check whether a match for the request is found in the[`CacheStorage`](%14313 "The CacheStorage interface represents the storage for Cache objects.")using[`CacheStorage.match()`](%14317 "The match() method of the CacheStorage interface (available globally as caches) checks if a given Request or url string is a key for a stored Response. This method returns a Promise for a Response, or undefined if no match is found."). If so, serve that.
1. If not, open the`v1`cache using`open()`, put the default network request in the cache using[`Cache.put()`](%14312 "The put() method of the Cache interface allows key/value pairs to be added to the current Cache object.")and return a clone of the default network request using`return response.clone()`. Clone is needed because`put()`consumes the response body.
1. If this fails (e.g., because the network is down), return a fallback response.

```
var response;
var cachedResponse = caches.match(event.request).catch(function() {
  return fetch(event.request);
}).then(function(r) {
  response = r;
  caches.open('v1').then(function(cache) {
    cache.put(event.request, response);
  });  
  return response.clone();
}).catch(function() {
  return caches.match('/sw-test/gallery/myLittleVader.jpg');
});
```
