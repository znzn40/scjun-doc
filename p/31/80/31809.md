The**`inherit`**CSS keyword causes the element for which it is specified to take the[computed value](%28556 "")of the property from its parent element.It can be applied to any CSS property, including the CSS shorthand[`all`](%29726 "The all CSS shorthand property sets all of an element's properties (other than unicode-bidi and direction) to their initial or inherited values, or to the values specified in another stylesheet origin.").



For[inherited properties](%35742 "en/CSS/inheritance"), this reinforces the default behavior, and is only needed to override another rule. For[non-inherited properties](%35742 "en/CSS/inheritance"), this specifies a behavior that typically makes relatively little sense and you may consider using[`initial`](%31805 "The initial CSS keyword applies the initial (or default) value of a property to an element. It can be applied to any CSS property.")instead, or[`unset`](%31808 "The unset CSS keyword resets a property to its inherited value if it inherits from its parent, and to its initial value if not. ")on the[`all`](%29726 "The all CSS shorthand property sets all of an element's properties (other than unicode-bidi and direction) to their initial or inherited values, or to the values specified in another stylesheet origin.")property.



Inheritance is always from the parent element in the document tree, even when the parent element is not the containing block.


## Example<a name="Example"></a>

```
/* Make second-level headers green */
h2 { color: green; }

/* ...but leave those in the sidebar alone so they use their parent's color */
#sidebar h2 { color: inherit; }
```


In this example the`h2`elements inside the sidebar might be different colors. For example, if one of them were the child of a div matched by the rule ...


```
div#current { color: blue; }
```


... it would be blue.
