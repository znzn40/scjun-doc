## [](%5378#_name "")NAME<a name="_name"></a>


git-mktree - Build a tree-object from ls-tree formatted text





## [](%5378#_synopsis "")SYNOPSIS<a name="_synopsis"></a>

```
git mktree [-z] [--missing] [--batch]
```




## [](%5378#_description "")DESCRIPTION<a name="_description"></a>


Reads standard input in non-recursive`ls-tree`output format, and creates a tree object. The order of the tree entries is normalized by mktree so pre-sorting the input is not required. The object name of the tree object built is written to the standard output.





## [](%5378#_options "")OPTIONS<a name="_options"></a>
<dl><dt id='git-mktree--z'>[](%5378#git-mktree--z "")-z</dt><dd>

Read the NUL-terminated`ls-tree -z`output instead.

</dd><dt id='git-mktree---missing'>[](%5378#git-mktree---missing "")--missing</dt><dd>

Allow missing objects. The default behaviour (without this option) is to verify that each tree entryâ€™s sha1 identifies an existing object. This option has no effect on the treatment of gitlink entries (aka &quot;submodules&quot;) which are always allowed to be missing.

</dd><dt id='git-mktree---batch'>[](%5378#git-mktree---batch "")--batch</dt><dd>

Allow building of more than one tree object before exiting. Each tree is separated by as single blank line. The final new-line is optional. Note - if the`-z`option is used, lines are terminated with NUL.
